Computational syntax is concerned about the questions of the structures of natural language sentences (grammar):
- what kinds of representations allow you best to describe what sentences are grammatical/possible in a langauge?
- what kidns of sentence structure are and are not possible in any given human languages?
- to what extent are these grammatical rules langauge-specific and learnbed, and to what extend to they represent something universal about human cognition?
