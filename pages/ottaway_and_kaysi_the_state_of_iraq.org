  Federalism had largely receded after the Kurds got what they wanted from the constitution, but [[id:E2CE0498-2FF2-4CB7-9035-AE553CB87516][article 140]] and future disputes over oil and gas made it untenable

  Additional decentralization flared in 2012, Speaker Nujeifi in mid-June 2012 hinted that Sunnis in Iraq might ask for separation
