- why do some systems have very fine grained visibility metrics?
- because they are lossy systems
- non-redundant systems tend to have more granular monitoring
- important to keep in mind
- never want to have lossy monitoring and and non-redundant systems
- complexity is orthogonal to monitoring granularity, it's the information loasyness
