- 1960-1970's counter insurgency, deliberately kept a low profile, small deployment of british troops, used local forces called the firqa
- started going well once the SAS left, key lesson was that dhofar does not require a large scale over presnse of foreign troops, foreing actors "cannot take ownership of the problem"
