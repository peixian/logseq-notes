Inis L. Claude Jr. “Collective Security as an Approach to Peace.” Accessed February 2, 2021.

- Collective security is a halfway point between anarchy and world governement
- talks about how collective security has become a bandied about term, but means something completely different
#+begin_quote
The achievement of orthodox status is very often fatal to the integreity of a concept
#+end_quote
- "collective security" began as a specialized term, initially meant to hamstring aggressions
  - now has largely lost its meaning, appropriated for any & all approaches to collective actions that build peace and order, synonym for world peace
- collective security should be defined as "a second line of defense against wars where settlement should but does not prevent a war"
- assumptions: wars are likely to occur and most can be prevented
- about forestalling the arbitrary & aggresive use of force
- constract with pacific security
  - pacific security - moral ambiguity, uses tools like investigating, reconciliation, arbitration, etc
  - collective security - moral clarity, uses diplomatic, economic, and military sanctions
* subjective requirements on collective security
- aggression in one part of the world is not localized, things can easily spread
- people & states must recongize their interests align with the international
  - demands that many national loyalities become harmonized
    - is this similar to how domestic institutions ahve aligned with [[id:CA1EA832-614A-4720-A87E-04CAD3716E0A][Barnett et al: International Organizations and the Diffusions of Power]]?
- fundalmentally requires the state to give up very much
  - control of military
  - follow rulebook adherence to international order
  - runs against the instincts of statement and politicians
- collective security is meant to be used against any state, anonomous aggressors and anonomyous victims
- states *must* be confidence in collective security, or else the whole thing falls apart
* objective requirements
- power: requires several great powers of equal strength
- membership: must be universal, assumes any state may become aggressor
  - proposes that the preponderance of power be available to any state
- aims for the organization of police action, requires a world where every state is caught in and dependent on one other
- requires large scale disarmament and lack of economic self sufficiency
