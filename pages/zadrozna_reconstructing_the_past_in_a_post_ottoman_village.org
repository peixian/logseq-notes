Talks about the "Memory House of Ataturk" ([[id:56E74CD3-17D3-467F-A8CD-A8C3B8563573][mustafa kemal]]) as a focal point for macedonian ethnic identities, utilization of Ataturk as a symbol and claiming him (either through his lineage or pan-Turkishness) to be a rallying point.

#+begin_quote
historical consciousness is not a homogenous but rather a multilayered and complex process which can encompass apparently contradicting narratives of the past, not only within one nation-state - pg 12
#+end_quote

3 types of self identification:
1) Macedonian
2) "Turk" <- isolated to the Lower Zupa region
3) Torbesi

Identities revolve around primordialist arguments but are linked to political ones:
#+begin_quote
"Macedonians" support Macedonian political parties, the majority of the "Turks" vote for the Democratic Party of the Turks, and the Torbesi support the Part for European Future - PEI, which have actively worked for the legal recongition of the Torbesi as a separate ethnic group - pg 4

* Who own Ataturk?
  - Based on ideals that Ataturk's father was born in Kocacik, some groups claim ethic Turkishness
    - Application of a constructed identity in modern times flowing backwards in time
    - possibly helped by the Turkish nation's embracing of Ottoman identities - [[id:FFC8DC1C-7DB3-4E76-8594-C64AD5C17564][Danforth: The Ottoman Empire from 1923 to Today]]
