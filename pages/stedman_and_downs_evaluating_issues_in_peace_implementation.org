- Stedman, Stephen John, and George Downs, eds. “Evaluating Issues in Peace Implementation.” In Ending Civil Wars: The Implementation of Peace Agreements. Boulder, Colo: Lynne Rienner, 2002.

- Peace implementation differs based on peace environment, including three major factors
  1. Presence of spoilers
  2. Hostile neighboring states
  3. Resources available for extraction ([[id:ACAEDCED-C16E-47CB-8EE5-2A8C0977735C][resource curse]])

- UN has only succeeded in the least challenging environments
- How do we measure success?
  - measurement by mandate achievement
    - can be worked around by setting modest mandate goals
    - nations can also offload impossible tasks to the UN
    - does not ask any questions about the appropriateness of the mandate
  - conflict reduction, disputant resolution, etc
    - variety of metrics can be evaluated
    - how/what is the appropriate ensemble
    - difficulty in ascribing a casual relationship to the mission
- can success be measued by looking @ subgoals?
  - likely to be biased towards ascribing a clean casual relationship
  - i.e. human rights watch is more likely to say the failure of human rights causes problems
- mission success as:
  - end of large scale violence
  - sustainable peace in wartime
- certain regions are off limits (less in Asia, never in a P5 country, avoids civil war in countries with large armies)
- issues with success
  - # of warring parties
  - absense of pre-signed peace agreement
  - liklihood of spoilers
  - collapsed state
  - # of soldiers
  - disposable natural resources
  - hostile neighboring states
  - wars of succession

- conclusion: important to think about the metrics that we think of as "successful"
