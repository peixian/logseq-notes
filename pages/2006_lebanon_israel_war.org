Israel's war objectives were not defined consistently, wanted to both destroy [[id:DE11B1DE-9DE7-4B29-A074-C962666085E1][hezbollah]], return israeli soldiers, halt the firiing of rockets, etc

Ultimately seen as a failure, the critical issue was that israel assumed everyone subscribed to the same understanding of objectives, whereas hezbollah's objective was to simply survive

General Dan Halutz stepped down after this war, advocated that 'vicotry is a matter of consciousness'
