Talks about how the Kube API server is the fundalmental broker with multiple replicated logs or queues. Events are causually related, and every [[id:F5441954-B74E-4FF3-BE85-653D7B55AD50][controllers (k8s)]] can be understood to be a producer and/or consumer of events from these logs.
- ~ListWatch~ in k8s, which lists all events from the API server when the consumer starts, then switches to "watch mode" to reduce the load
- queue is fundalmentally decoupling both the consumer and producer (with a queue)

No guarentee that things will ever reach the desired state, but it is optimistically trying, which makes controllers stateless even when they handle state operations, and do not require persistency!
