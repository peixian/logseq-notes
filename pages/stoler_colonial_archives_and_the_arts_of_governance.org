* Colonial Archives and the Arts of Goverance - Ann Stoler
  - Complains that the archival studies remain more extractive than ethnographic
  - Focus on "archive as a process" rather than things
  - "Archives as epistemological experiments rather than as sources, to colonial archives as cross-sections of contested knowledge"
    - Similar to [[id:B1E26B6E-6A74-4E81-8A49-B18EF81BFDAE][DiCapua - Gatekeepers of the Arab Past]]
  - EE Evans Prtichard's warning that "anthropology would have to choose between being history and being nothing"
    - E.E. Evans-Pritchard "Social Antropology: Past and Present. The Marett Lecture, 1950"
  - "Archive fever" has grasped modern anthropology
  - Students reject the content of colonial archives but rather attend to the form or context
    - We reject the information in the archives
    - But who is interviewed? Why are they interviewed
  - Identifying bias:
    - Shaped:
      - What could be written
      - What warrented repetition
      - What competensies were rewarded in archival writing
      - What stories could not be told
      - What could not be said
  - Derrida's "there is no political power without control of the archive"
    - Who controls the [[id:A03F7254-8635-4AB2-B420-AB5A01DF1F10][iraqi archives]]
  - Colonial archives reproduced the power of the state
    - Modern readings of colonial archives are read against the grain
  - Pause at, rather than bypass the unspoken practices
    - How are things organized? Why are they collected together?
  - Archives also keep secrets
    - What secrets are worth keeping?
    - What secrets are kept because of disagreements?
      - Dutch colonial archives classified documents beacuse they could not agree, or sometimes because of the magnitude of the problem
