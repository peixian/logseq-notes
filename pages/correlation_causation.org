- At large scales, everything is correlated
- Interrcorrelation implies causal networks
  - A correlates to B, B correlates to A, or A correlates to C + C correlates to B
    - This is most often wrong, since it's actually:
      - A correlates to B
      - B correlates to A
      - A correlates to C1, B correlates to C1
      - A correlatees to C2, B correlates to C2, etc
  - Relationships are directly casual, or they can flow through a huge number of causal chains
