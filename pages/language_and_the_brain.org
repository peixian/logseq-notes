[[id:12580BAB-8366-47AD-A690-BAB8B773FA85][fall 2021 classes]]

* Class 1
  - What do linguists do?
  - Linguists as part of cognitive science
    - What is the consquences of this view?
    - [[id:A47A6C46-2AB7-4845-BAD2-E5197E5148D9][Chomsky - Syntatic Structures]] as the dawn of generative grammar
  - There exists some sentences of setnences such that it allows for recursive composition
  - So once we setup the idea that English cannot be a FSM, what is the data?
  - Langauges that use case markings
    - case markings allow it to mtaintain a more consistent structure modulo case marking
  - chomsky is unconcerned with the statistical metadata that arises from a corpus
    - "internalist" - grammars and structures within a single sentence
    - "externalist" - set of sentences within a corpus
  - for sentences to make sense, we assign a phoronlogical structure to pronounce sentences
    - which then means a sentence makes sense iff:
      - syntax (chomsky is here) is correct
      - phoronological sufficent (this can be derived from statistics)
  - "there exists a faculty of language" - but is there a _single_ faculty of langauge

* Class 2 - 9/13
  - what is the neo-durkheimian relationship between langauge and thought?
  - is language just a set of sentences?
    - in the 70's, they thought that sentences are a sequence of words or sounds
    - what does this leave out? -> hidden syntax and semantics
      - syntax cannot directly be seen
      - semantics sometimes contain a truth value
      - oftentimes this forms the $\{form/sound, meaning\}$
      - chomsky identified this as a triplet of $\{form, syntax, meaning\}$
  - sentences in english are infinite due to recursion (aka not finite structured)_
    - chomsky also distinguished between "lists" and "conjunctions"
    - lists as $\mathbb{N}$
    - however, langauge (or at least english) is "uninterestingly" infinite
      - as you push further out and generate more sentences, the sentences themselves become regularized
  - for chomsky, grammar is the compression of language, and if you memorize words you can generate an infinite set of sentences
  - also must make a distinction between "actual" and "potential"
    - "actual" sentences are bound by the maximum speaker time or computation time
    - "potential" sentences are the infinite set of all sentences generatable
  - what are the grammatical rules for telling us if a word is an actual word?
    - "moak" -> is this a word?
    - we have grammars to say this is a potential word, but to reject a word, we actually do a semi-exhaustive search through our internal dictionaries to find out
  - some words enter the vernacular after it is used
    - "jabberwocky", for example
  - how do we distinguish words that are archaeic/low frequency from words that are incorrect?
    - side note [[id:ACE0CB1E-B2C4-4057-BA71-8754CF588D4C][finite state languages]] can delinate infinite sets
    - this is known as the "[[id:3C4FC419-136F-4E3D-9CE7-9250895A9649][strong and weak generative capacity]]"
  - what was the theory of cognitive science before the 60's?
    - behavioralism
  - _learning is the intentional modification of the environment in order to produce different future behaviors_
  - what is actually being "learned" when you acquire a langauge?
    - a child does not do a blind word/object association (i.e. this is a ball)
    - the faculty of langauge extends beyond this into "teaching" or "learning" a grammar and a generative capacity
  - grammars have variance built in
    - this is why we speak differently
    - [[id:DBF4E5C3-D7C8-4E4E-B881-A0257FAA345E][language accomodation in arabic]]
