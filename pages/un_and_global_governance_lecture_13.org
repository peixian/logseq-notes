* presentation planning
- small summary
- background and history of sexual violence
  - how it became popular
- issues with papers and methodology
  - statistics here implies intercorrelation under casual networks
    - everything is correlated and bet on sparsity principals
- paper one pager
  - The mechanics of the mission entails several second order effects
    - interactions with local populations
      - sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) - Karim & Beardsly
        - Finds that reductions of SEA require "cultivation of value for gender equality among all peacekeepers"
      - peacekeeper babies - Simić and O'Brien
        - First became a concern in Liberia and East Timor
        - Zero tolerance policy remains muddly and makes little distinction between exploitative and consensual relationships.
    - host government
      - taxation and pay
        - Host governments are often in a weak position, and UN tax exemptions "undermines the building of a viable local revenue authority"
        - Because the UN often pays more than civil service positions, a "brain drain" may occur from civil servant roles towards UN ones
      - question of whether the government exists or not
        - Lack of sweage and sanitation systems can magnify issues the UN brings, such as cholera - Lemay-Hébert
    - these effects have a direct impact on the success of the mission
      - technocratic fixes tend to ignore interactions with the local populace
      - engagements with the host government are shallow and often act as the UN is not on the ground
      - these effects are not necessarily "unintented", but rather delayed and not considered at the start of the mission


- Second order effects abound:
  - Sexual exploitation and abuse of local populations by peacekeepers began to be addressed in 2002

* presentation
- will talk about uninteded and second order effects of UN peacekeepers
- focuses on the mechanics of peacekeeping troops
- Will be split into talking about the UN's interactions with local populations, with the host government and broader takeaways

* adam day
  - political economy lens
    - understands how the impact of interventions in the systems in the markets
  - modern conflicts are driven by greed
    - greed vs grievance (jake sherman - greed and greivance)
    - paul collier - greed explains better than grievance, economic models predict better than political ones
      - binary does not necessarily exist
      - granularity of nation level does not actually tell us very much
  - shift in scope and ambition and usage of force in peacekeeping
  - oversight of peace agreements to building of state authority and capacity building
  - model of conflict where the state needs to be extended
  - give war a chance - luttwak
    - elite bargins project
  - peacebuilding and authoritarianism
  - statebuilding ideaology - susan woodward
  - elite capture of peacebuilding
  - severene autessare - the trouble with the congo
