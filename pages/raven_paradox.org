Logical paradox about the scientific method:
- If a raven is black, and your hypothesis is that "ravens are black", then every raven you see that is black supports the hypothesis
- However, the cohort of this is that "if a thing is a raven, then it is black"
  - This means that non-raven non-black things support the hypothesis, which is nuts
  - So inherently there is a ranking of evidence, not non-raven non-black things are weaker evidence than a black raven
    - A la bayesian inference
  - However, baysesian inference requires you to know the rough % of non-black non-ravens to black ravens,
    - This number can be estimated, but where is it from?
