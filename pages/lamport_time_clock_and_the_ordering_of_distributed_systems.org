- https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf
- Uses "happens before" - partial ordering of events
  - Introduces a way to sync the /total/ ordering
  - provides for clocks, how to translate it to actual clocks

- is time subjective? is it independent of observers?
- is there a way to capture "happen before" without clocks?
  - can we determine if a single event preceded another without the measurement of objective time?
  - on differing nodes
  - total ordering of events cannot be done, only partial ordering on specific nodes
    - 1: a-b-c
    - 2: x-y-z
    - a comes before b and c, but a does /not/ come before x, y, or z
- "happens before"
  - /a/ and /b/ are in the same process, and /a/ comes before /b/, /a/ happens before /b/
  - if /a/ sends a message and /b/ receives it, /a/ must happen before /b/
  - if /a/ -> /t/ and /t/ -> /b/ then /a/ -> /b/
    - transitivity
