- you learn statistically
- do you define stuff by it's effects? what you can interact with in the sandwhich/hot dog
  - we can choose a model for which they are the same (both breaded, both filling)
- we can train a model to recongize flowers by watching videos of bees, but the model is then trained on the visibile wavelength whereas bees are trained on the UV wavelength
- category theory is constraints given form
  - which is why programmers love this shit
- we've precisely defined the base, but we haven't done anything that is generic
- math is generic though
- how can we better ask "what is a thing"
  - foundations of mathematics
- meaning out of reference
  - meaning is defined as a use of a thing
  - latent spaces
