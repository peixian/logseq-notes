As of April 17th, 2020, 3 new unknown militia groups have appeared:
- Usbat Al-Thaereen
- Ashab Al-Kahf
- Qabdat Al-Hoda

* Usbat Al-Thaereen
- _The establishment of Usbat al-Thaereen, as it claimed responsibility for the latest attacks on U.S. bases, will heighten tensions between Washington and Tehran._
 - By Sunday evening, a video emerged online from a group called “Usbat al-Tha’ireen” (The League of Revolutionaries), claiming that their members conducted both recent attacks on Camp Taji

- First released statement on March 18th
- Very similar to [[id:F56A8565-CED0-45C2-A53B-B186DF72A1C9][kataib hezbollah (kh)]], [[id:C95CCC60-FDB5-470E-BFEE-80BD88A1EB6E][harakat hezbollah al-nujaba]] and [[id:429AAD3F-9AD1-4842-9B55-F6B18BEF36CB][kataib sayyid al-shuhada]]
- Unknown if new or existing PMF members and within which framework
- Perhaps a new missle unit?
- Mystery shrouding to prevent being targeted?

- _After the killing of Soleimani, Ali Shamkhani, secretary-general of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said: "We will establish a new armed group of more than 2,000 people in the region. The main function of this group of mujahideen is to remove U.S. forces from the region."_
