** Consitution Making
   - [[id:74B098C9-54AD-4255-8680-09D079DC73F9][iraqi constitutionalism]]
   - [[id:B7920589-79CC-4353-A685-8C5DAE0AEAB4][tunisia]] consitution writing was transparent
   - [[id:98F9993A-F5AD-44C5-A732-8BBAD7FA6BEE][egypt]]ian constituion writing was not

     - ex [[id:B7920589-79CC-4353-A685-8C5DAE0AEAB4][tunisia]], [[id:FA6F5293-2FFF-4468-ACCF-A3C3C860AA5C][kenya]], [[id:B54391B6-737B-4B73-ACB2-C6E07800A51D][south africa]], [[id:268E1F7D-3F00-4AE3-B785-5B1E8F3BCE08][thailand]], [[id:B4ACF3C1-63C1-4626-8429-2D7EC157FCBE][papua new guinea]], [[id:9347A041-2696-4CCC-B8F6-842549F366CD][uganda]], [[id:F8CA4C8E-F55A-4FF6-8709-52BE50E88DB4][brazil]]
   - debates about the inclusiveness of the process vs inclusiveness of the adoption

*** Constitution Writing in Egypt
    - 2 constitutions: 2012 and 2014
    - both lead by the intermim military government (SCAZ)
      - low legitimacy
    - 2012 -> egyptian parliment selected members to assembly
    - 2014 -> rewrite due to problems of 2012, 2014 did not include islamists in parliment

*** Consitution Writing in Tunisia
    - Written by the National Constituiant Assembly
      - Body had the power to adopt
      - public could vote on the members
      - first draft was adoped by a 2/3rds vote
    - More inclusive over multiple drafts that were relased to the public

*** Constitution Writing in Conflict Zones
    - How to permit public engagement with security issues?
    - How to prevent actors from co-opting the process?

**** [[id:C21DF9B0-E7E9-44F9-91A2-EEA809BD6293][libya]]
     - Fissures between the National Transitional Council (NTC), the General National Congress (GNC), and Constitutional Drafting Assembly (CDA)
     - Eternal problem: who gets a seat?
     - UN largely helped to push it along, despite many issues such as the appelate court ruling against the CDA and various boycotts

**** [[id:87825E0D-CF52-42BD-AC39-4EAC4B565EA3][yemen]]
     - National Dialogue Conference in 2013 with the post GCC mediated transition
       - Produced over 1800 recommendations
       - Document was lauded, spoiled by the [[id:C07B8EF3-C4B7-45CB-8671-33A6E45160C8][houthis]] and [[id:5AE0CC8E-FC28-4776-A862-EDF1F8AD2684][south Hiraak movement]]
         - Both wanted a 2 region state

*** Multiethnic Governence
    - Two main patterns
      - Consociationalism -> accomdation via guarenteed representation
      - Centripedalism -> moderation of ethnic group views

**** Consociationalism
     - Protects specific ethnic groups from harm
     - usually grants some combo of autonomy, veto or partial veto, political representation
     - "A peace treaty extended to government"
     - Issue: sometimes accomodates ethnic extremists

**** Centripedalism
     - Rewards moderate behavior
     - Mechanisms such as:
       - alternative vote
       - candidates requiring plurality of vote across ethnically diverse territories

**** Models
***** Ethnic federalism
      - Form of consoctionalism
      - questioned whether this actually exasterbates or ameloriates confict
      - usually has some of:
        - protection for cultural and linguistic identity - [[id:B54391B6-737B-4B73-ACB2-C6E07800A51D][south africa]]
        - ethnic based "self rule" - [[id:2D37CB04-B620-4192-8432-9F6AA6266706][ethopia]]
        - subnational constiutions - [[id:3D669C14-9C67-43A0-9580-04E5EEB10849][iraq]]
        - political and legal autonomy - [[id:0B9FAF9E-0A55-44FE-96CE-D6D382CF6617][KRG/iraqi kurdistan]], [[id:2D37CB04-B620-4192-8432-9F6AA6266706][ethopia]]
        - political decentralization
          - federal/unitary/localist
            - [[id:3D669C14-9C67-43A0-9580-04E5EEB10849][iraq]] - localist due to kurds
            - [[id:3196ECF7-71C2-43FE-A065-F3984D89DD1E][kosovo]] - local gov prevents the partition of the state along ethnic lines
***** [[id:C21DF9B0-E7E9-44F9-91A2-EEA809BD6293][libya]]
      - no centripedal or consociationalism
      - one big unitary state envisioned
***** [[id:87825E0D-CF52-42BD-AC39-4EAC4B565EA3][yemen]]
      - some consociational features
      - de facto ethic federation
      -
**** Human Rights
     - Egypt and Tunisia both explictly refer to human rights law
     - Tunisia has actual mechanisms to enforce
**** Enforcement
     - Constitutions lack legitimacy if not enforced
     - Concept of "Abusive Constituionalism" - Use of mechanisms of constitutionalism to undermine democracy
***** Egypt
      - no consitutional court
***** [[id:B7920589-79CC-4353-A685-8C5DAE0AEAB4][tunisia]]
      - constituional court
      - multiiple new comissions
**** Conclusion
     - constituion making in conflict make be the norm
     - there must be a state as a prereq
