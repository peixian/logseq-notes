#+begin_quote
Peacekeeping is based on the trinity of consent, neutrality/impartiality and the use of force in self-defence.
#+end_quote

Talks about how neutrality has been abandoned, but the impartailty of force should make up for it

Makes a clear distinction between a peacekeeping operation and a coercive peace enforcement action

However, the UN must mediate between actors, and in selecting the actors it inherently legitimizes by making them a party to the negotiations

Notes that UN also must have verticle consent, between some groups on the ground, the state, and everyone in between, but not necessarily all the groups of each category
