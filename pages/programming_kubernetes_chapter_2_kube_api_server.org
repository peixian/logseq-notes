Kube API basics
- Core responsbilities
  - serve the Kube API -> reading/manipluating state, usually in etcd
  - proxy cluster components

* HTTP Interface
[[id:41841396-B9E0-4E93-81AF-6371999B3B38][http]] interface provides 4 structures:
1. Kinds
   - Type of entity, each object has a kind
   - usually 3 categories of kinds
     1) objects -> a persistent entity within the system
     2) lists -> 1 or more kinds
     3) special purpose -> for special actions, like status
2. API Group
   - collection of kinds that are logically related
   - like ~/apis/core~
3. Version
   - each API group can (and likely does) exist as multiple versions
   - All objects are either in one API version or none
4. Resource
   - lowercase, plural word that identifies a set of HTTP endpoints
     - usually sends and receives a single kind
     - can have subrouses, usually implemented with custom HTTP protocols like [[id:853EF83B-71AB-4B99-A19A-F3C72FDAB838][websockets]]
   - always corresponds to an HTTP path



* GVR and GVK
  - Group Version Resource (GVR)
    - Uniquely identifies a HTTP path
  - Group Version Kind (GVK)
    - what a GVR returns


* Special Notes
- ~api/v1~ exists outside of ~apis~ as a legacy holdover, should be ~apis/core/v1~
- cluster wide entities have different values, such as ~/metrics~, ~/logs~, and ~/healthz~
- specs vs status
  - specifications - desired state for a resource
  - status - observed state for a resource
* API server internals
Each API group has a specific handler, and there are 6 different phases internally
1. Entry
2. Authn/authz
3. mutation admission -> this is where the incoming request can be transformed
4. schema validation
5. validating admission -> large part of the validation logic
6. etcd
