Anthony Alessandrini
- end of "white populism" as a fever dream
- https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/des/article/view/18630
- white working class fails to achieve a class conciousness
  - engagement and move towards white elites
- is it a violence indentended to maintain the current state of violence
- constellation of alternatives  - angela davis

Cubukcu Ayca
- leftwing in one place may be rightwing in another

Alejandro Velasco
- reading the last 15-20 years from leftwing uprisings to rightwing countermovements
  - there is something that is /the right/ and /the left/ and the /middle/
  - major challenge of the right in [[id:541B7BAF-591F-4CF8-8292-D83E8FB9D095][latam]] is not in policy or method, but with epistemic on revisionism on vocabulary
- right came back to power through deft usage of parlimentary procedures, and strategic deployment of liberal discourses
  - whitewhashing of liberal values grounded in the supremcy of individual rights
- usage of the liberal's inability to see their discourses being used in another fashion
- hid the accomplishments of the left in power by switching the debate to the failures of the left
  - cannot be understated, pink tide forced the right to specific positions
    - forced right to tackle the distribution of resources
      - [[id:3FB1A712-15FE-416D-A75A-BAB6CB10922F][argentina]], [[id:2680B2EC-B8C8-4F4E-BAC8-3B430AE5AF97][chile]]
- left's dependence on the activist model
- the left's mode is always a defensive one, but the horizon of possiblities is constrained by the discourses of the right
- bolivia -> the wake of a morales
- chile -> tremednous upsurge around rewriting of constitution
- abandonment of the idea that the right and left exist, camoloughing this with "authortiarianism" or "facism" is different for social justice
Vijay Prashad
- crossing boundaries leads to overt abstraction
- revolutions post WW2 happen in poverty
  - gini coefficient
