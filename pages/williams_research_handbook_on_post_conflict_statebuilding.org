* Part 4: Legacies of Conflict
  - Transitional justice & peacebuilding scholars disagree often
  - Transitional justice is:
    - truth telling
    - reparations
    - prosectuions
    - legislation
    - vetting of institutions
  - io's can aid the process by providing funding, legal guidence, and increased legitmacy
    - [[id:B7499357-D6DD-4419-B930-1338431AED56][Pouligny - Peace Operations Seen From Below]] describes how the UN provides legitamacy
  - IDP's and refugees need to be resettled
    - property disputes especially
      - i.e. [[id:A9E01CBD-FC46-42E8-B5D8-41CC27DC6E60][Philliou: Interpreting the Ottoman Past through the National Present]]

* Part 5: Rule of Law
  - Poorly implemented in [[id:4A892609-EEF5-441D-92CD-0330210D954F][bosnia]]
  - conflict removes power from pre-existing laws
  - Defined as:
    #+begin_quote
    a principal for goverence in which all persons, institutions, and entities, public and private, including the state itself are accountable to laws that are public promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards
    #+end_quote
  - Loosely 3 perspectives:
    1. procedural/narrow view
       - creation of an impartial court system
       - no IO influence on what the laws actually say
    2. substantive/middle view
       - adds some concerns about what the laws say
       - some io influence
    3. Human rights/broad
       - requires states to uphold human rights & promotion of democratic freedoms
       - significant io involvement in laws
  - The perfect legal code has little impact without proper judicial procedures

* Part 6: Development
  - Deficits, debt, domestic revenue problems, poverty, unemployment, inequality
  - Distinction between relief and emergency aid
