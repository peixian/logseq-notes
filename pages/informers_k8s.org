- Gives higher level programming interface for most common use case of watches: in memory caching and fast lookup of objects by name or other properties
- basically an in-mem cache that sits between watch events and the user code
- has advanced error behaviors, such as correcting for when long-running watch connections break
- one of the main concepts of k8s design
- preferred over polling, but creates load on the API server, each binary should only instantiate one informer per GVR
- generated from a code generator and shipped as part of client-go
- register handlers, and then start the shared informer factory
- note: there is a lag between when the api server updates something and when the informer updates something
- note: never mutate objects from informers, always deep copy
