- inspired by https://commoncog.com/blog/lessons-learnt-from-reading-51-books-in-2018/
- didn't think that blogging about reading was a thing
- 2017: https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/64912470
  - 35 books
  - most impactful book: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35710804-the-field-study-handbook
    - I liked it because it was good inspiration, which sounds vapid, but is the truth
  - book I didn't even remember I read: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31119360-typewriters-bombs-jellyfish
    - honestly can't recall a single essay out of this book
  - books I liked
    - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17454723-no-good-men-among-the-living
      - very touching, good piece of war reporting
    - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32714239-twitter-and-tear-gas
      - somewhat kicked off my interest in the middle east
- 2018: https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/64912470
  - 58 books
  - most impactful book: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36723066-brothers-of-the-gun, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27403373-judas, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34329421-the-shell
    - brothers of a gun was a solidifying moment for me about the middle east
    - judas is a weird but very interesting novel, although I don't recall much of it, deserves a reread
    - the shell is a scary book, flip side of syria
  - book I didn't even remember I read: ...most of the books honestly
    - This year I mostly spent reading and jamming through a variety of books, from Aftershocks to a Biography of the Quran to Becoming Fluent

  - books I liked: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38820047-killing-commendatore, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25716554-the-master-and-margarita
    - Murakami fan, of course I would like it
    - Master and Margarita is a delight

- 2019: https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/64912470
  - 28 books
  - most impactful book: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done
    - hate that this book is so effective, I really didn't want to become one of those people that adopts it

  - book I didn't even realize I read: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/98418.Literature_from_the_Axis_of_Evil_
    - seem to recall this was interesting but have completely forgotten about it
  - books I liked: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17656566-the-locust-effect, https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23012836-the-great-war-for-civilisation
    - locust effect presented an obvious-but-interesting thesis
    - fisk's book is interesting for people who are interested in the middle east, it's a massive book and he's a crank now, but written when he wasn't a crank
      - chewed through most of this in amman
- 2020:
  still working through it, but I'm on track for 52 books.

  - favorite book so far: [[id:9675FEBA-A78E-4DE1-83CF-E04D66C221AF][Taking Smart Notes]]
    - inspired me to start writing more and keeping more notes
  - mostly inspired by a class on the post-ottoman near east
    - a book a week mandated for a class is a great motivator

- Lessons learned:
  - Don't really believe in passive reading anymore
    - 2018 was my most active year and I barely recall reading it
    - passive reading is great for soaking up general knowledge, but I feel like I could've read a series of wikipedia articles and gotten the same effect
  - take reading seriously
    - don't just consume books anywhere
    - I consume low grade articles in line and spare times
    - book reading is sacred, which means *actively* planning for it
      - I'm lucky in that I rarely have other obligations on weekends
