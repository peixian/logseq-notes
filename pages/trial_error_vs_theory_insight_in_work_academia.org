- fractals of trial/error theory/insight paradigm
- programming is trial/error *as a skill*, but theory/insight *as a worker*
  - /That is, that trial & error is a superior strategy when i) you have randomness and ii) when you have convexity: that is, for any given decision you make, your positive outcomes outweigh your negative outcomes./
  - feedback loop is instantanous
  - take a hit and leave the game?
    - resiliance to failure is low
- school is theory/insight *as a worker*, but *trial/error* as a skill
  - feedback loop is slow and possibly non-existant
    - i.e. how do you test out theories of history? of nationalism?
    - monographs based on a collection of ideas
  - take a hit and remain in the game
    - resiliance to failure is high
