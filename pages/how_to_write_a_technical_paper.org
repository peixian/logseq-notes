    - Summary and outline
  - Background review should include:
    - trends
    - open problems
    - recent developments
    - also introduce specific terminology
  - Summary:
    - Problem description
    - Description of the solution
    - Arguments about the imacpts
  - Close introduction with paper outline

* Related Work
  - Gives a list of works that show what has happened in the field
  - Provides a critque to the approaches in the literature, establishes the importance of the paper
  - Show sthat the "homework" has been done
  - Distinguish and describe all the different approaches to the problem

* Problem Statement
  - Often merged with the system model
  - State the problem clearly, be exact in stating the question

* Solution
  - Provide overview of solution
  - Thorough description of the solution and its functionality


* Analysis
  - Qualitative and quantitative
  - Qualitative shows some properties of the solution
    - Profess of correctness
  - Quantitive shows some performance aspects of the solution
    - Performance analysis, which metrics?

* Simulation and Experimentation
  - Describe the environment of the simluation and experiments
  - Make sure that the simluation or experiments are statistically stable
