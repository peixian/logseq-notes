* Flow order
- Graph, scheduling, execution
  - constructs a flow order as a graph inside a python dict
  - assumptions: data is not modified in place, tasks do not hold the gil
    - python bindings for native interfaces may lock, these must be made sure to be released
* Dask vs Spark
  - similar to [[id:E707C883-BDB6-4409-B19A-FCAEE65985B2][spark]]
  - spark has a higher level data representation
  - dask uses numpy/pandas/sklear, spark is more mature and has sql support
  - dask allows to compute arbitrary graphs
  - spark allows computations from compositions of high level primitives or extending to rdd
