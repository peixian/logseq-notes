- since 2013, 195 have died
- Non-state actors create new dangers
- lack of pre-deployment training exposes problems
- spikes in casualities starting in 2011, continues until today
- claims that people plan peacekeeping missions w/o being aware of the risks
- combination of defensive posture, risk-adverse usage of force, and unwise risk taking leads to deaths
- poor combination of lack of intelligence, poor information sharing, and bad training makes for unmeshed peacekeeping operations
- missions are large, various bureacratic turf wars for operations and logistics
* key problems
1) organization level of the UN has not adapted
2) leadership is lacking, especially @ sector commander level
3) missions have unmmaned, undermanned, and ill-equipped troops
4) failure to have strong response after serious attacks lets criminals operate with inpunity
5) pre-deployment readiness must be followed, no more caveats
6) in mission training, less cycling of troops (most troops leave every 6 months)
7) poor infrastructure in country threatens all
8) IED detection and attacks on camps/bases
9) lacking intelligence
10) field health care also lacking
11) mission footprint needs to be oriented
12) mutual accountability by all
