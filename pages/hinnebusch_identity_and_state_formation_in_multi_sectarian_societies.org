- State formation and identity in MENA are not necessarily co-terminus
  - Sect and class are not necessarily orthonognal
- Claims that the westphalian state was unnaturally applied to MENA
- 3 levels of identity
  - Supra-state
    - Islam, Ummah, Pan-Arabism, etc
  - State level
    - Nationalism, secularism, etc
  - Sub-state
    - Sectarian, tribal, etc
- Hybrid states with multiple identities can exist for a surprisingly long time
- In the long run, strong, inclusive states and national identities work in tandem, alongside weak states and sectarianism. But the curve is not linear and has multiple permutations.

* Case of Syria
  - Intial state formation: 1946-1963
    - Largely weak oligarchic weak states, but somewhat inclusive, subsumbed state identities
    - Embraced pan-Arabism
    - Largely similar lingustic background ([[id:47EF592A-10D4-4923-BE86-E3E03918624D][Anderson - Imagined Communities]]) allowed state formation
  - Ba'thist state building and identity: 1963-2000
    - Embraced distintly nationalist identities against Israel
    - Also embraced low level sectarian identities with Alawis
      - Still provided for Sunni penetration
    - Based on cold war patronage lines like [[id:7DD5C017-105C-4E9E-BE3D-0D8A77E849E0][nasser]]
    - sectarian arithmatic
      - _The regime thus exploited both supra‐state (Pan‐Arabism) state (Syrian civic nationalism), class, and sectarian identities to legitimize itself._ - pg 150

  - Neoliberal years: 2000-2010
    - Neolibral reforms reduced capacity for the state to dole out based on sectarian identities
    - No more patronage lines
