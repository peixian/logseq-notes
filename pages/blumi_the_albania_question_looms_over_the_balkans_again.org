Argues that Brussels and Washington have supported elites that are despised and fail to achieve better qualities of life for their constituancies

The  consequences  will  likely  prove  destabiliz-ing,  both  locally  and  beyond.  Opposition  to  an  entrenched political elite may take a more violent turn  if  citizens  realize  that  yet  again,  voting  in  elections will not result in real change. That would further expose the clear divergence of strategic in-terests that has arisen among NATO partners dur-ing the Trump era. Without the prospect of nego-tiations  for  EU  membership,  Brussels  risks  losing  influence  in  Albania,  Kosovo,  and  North  Mace-donia. That would give Turkey and Russia greater leverage,  as  outside  powers  once  again  jockey  to  shape the regionâ€™s politics.
