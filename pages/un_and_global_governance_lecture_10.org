* gustavo
- trial and error on developing better tools of dealing with peace in conflict
- extension of state building
- peacekeeping as an extension of government
- peacekeeping saw as a panacea
  - mandates became a christmas tree
- burundi and peacebuilding
- peacebuilding archiecture
  - what are we going to do in burundi?
  - PKO with local affairs run by NY
    - dealing with land reparations and returnees
  - DDR of FML and coup troops
  - UN used every single tool until 2010, where it no longer became successful
  - elections in 2010 was fairly workable, and everyone expected [[id:75596EDC-4243-41A7-A85A-8BC334C2048C][burundi]] to have worked
  - unresolved problems of returnees and the Arusha agreement
  - burundi has moved from success to failures in the last 5 years
  - what have learned?
    - concept matters
      - peacebuilding is much broader than simple DDR, "twin resolutions" of 2016
        - twin resolutions broke with linarity, conflict resolution
      - rather than have ticking boxes of needs ("X ministries, Y police officiers"), need to figure out how to the conceptual understanding of the sustained peace wrt to armies and all
    - the charter weighs heavy
      - anything that doesn't follow the charter is seen as counterproductive
    - how to transfer skills, not recieved actions
      - faciltating processes as an external actor
    - better recruitment
      - UN recruits people who know the UN system
        - but not necessarily about the local environs
    - everyone knows what drives the conflict, but few people know what sustains peace
      - too many things are done based on inertia
        - ex: SSR and DDR from SA applied to other places
        - theory of change -> assumption of what drives changes
        - concept of strategic patience
          - how far do you tolerate
    - liberal peacebuilding
      - problematic understanding of how to normalize peacebuilding within ideas
      - christmas is over
        - overprepartion for missions
    - our burcracies need to change

* burundi
- most successful with hybrid peace engagements
- types of activities and outreach the UN has done has not translated
-
