Sheeran, Scott, and Stephanie Case. “The Intervention Brigade: Legal Issues for the UN in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” n.d., 28.

- Talks about how the formation of the Intervention Brigade in [[id:26B73C8E-E769-417D-8383-E17DF3E1FE9E][united nations stabilization mission in the democratic republic of the congo (MONUSCO)]] was highly controversial and bold
- UN had not really considered the legal implications of having the entire brigade be partial to international humanitarian law
- Therefore the intervention brigade is a legal target, but leaves open the question about "regular" peacekeepers and UN staff
- Also does not elaborate on the right of the UN to hold prisoners, MONUSCO operates on some interim rules
- No longer impartial, as regularly required for peacekeeping operations
- unclear legal issues, the UN sees the intervention brigade as the only parts of MONUSCO subject ot legitimate targeting, but the ICRC does not
