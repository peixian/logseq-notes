* Aperature
  - Lower aperature means lower lens open
    - f/2.4 - f/8, etc
  - Changing aperture changes depth of field
  - Shallow depth of field is basically impossible on phone
  - Wider aperture means shallower depth of field
  - Shallower depth of field means more focus on closer thing

* ISO
  - Higher ISO means higher noise, but allows for faster shutter speed

* Exposure Triangle

* Light Meter
  - Only works on generalized assumptions
  - Databases, facial recongition, etc

* Depth of Field
  - Unlikely to achieve shallow depth of field from smartphone, due to small sensor
  - Has to make changes to ISO
    - No aperature changes on phones
  - Phone camers don't have a shutter!
  - Fast moving objects should be test shotted first!
  - ISO range is very different
  - Does have exposure compensation control
    - Makes up for the lack of manual overrides
  - Shooting in a RAW format lets you use manual exposure
  - Biggest diferences is in the actual mechanics of shooting
* Shooting with a smartphone
  - The flash is usually not needed. Typically switch it off
  - HDR feature should be turned off until assured needed
* Exposure
  - Use most of the frame
  - Dynamic range: ratio of darkest to brightest dynamic range
  - Brightness is measured in stops
    - Double light -> "1 stop"
    - Human eye has ~18 stops
  - Further away from the subject reduces the dynamic range
  - Pay attention, as the camera moves around, it makes for different decisions
  - Tapping for focus and exposure
* Low Light Shooting
  - Flash is unnatural
    - Especially for low light
  - Make sure elbows at your side
  - Don't hold breath (makes you shake more)
  - Wait for screen to go black
    - Don't trust the view finder
  - Careful of motion blur, view blurring, and others
    - Careful to tell you when the exposure is done
* Night Mode
  - Night mode on phones composite large numbers of photos
* Focal Length
  - Shooting with different focal length does not mean the image is the same
  - Lens changes the background
* Zooming
  - Don't bother with pinch to zoom
  - Take the shop, crop it later
* Shooting with flash
  - Fill flash -> filling in the shadowy areas with flash to compensate for high light in background
  - Flash on phones is not very strong, range is 3-4 ft
* Orientation
  - Most people shoot in portriat orientation
  - Drop to your knees to take a different PoV
* Aspect Ratio
  - 4:3 to 16:9
  - crop everything out you don't need
  - play around with where to put the horizon
* Black and White Photos
  - Potenially easier, less information
  - Stripping out the information density
  - The conversion in post-production is a lot easier
  - Gives the option to make the photo simplier
    - Look for photos about lines and shape and form
* Portrait Mode
  - Computational photography
    - Fakes shallow depth of field
  - Look for mistakes in the portrait mode filters
  - Not compatible with RAW
* Panorama Mode
  - Most useful for wider angle in a small space
    - Fakes a wide-angle lens
* Shooting in raw
  - Camera doesn't apply changes
  - Raw data from senors
  - Adjust white balance
  - Sometimes recover overexposed highlights
  - Higher bit depth
  - Does not:
    - Sharper image
    - Greater dynamic range
  - Strictly about editing
* Add on lenses
  - Macro lens lets you scale 1:1
