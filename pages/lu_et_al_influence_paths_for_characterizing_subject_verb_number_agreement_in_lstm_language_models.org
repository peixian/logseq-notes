#+TITLE: Lu et al: Influence Paths for Characterizing Subject-Verb Number Agreement in LSTM Language Models

Tags: [[id:48350662-53E9-4A91-9ADB-2BC9DFEA6098][nlp]], [[id:EE903E8E-E6F1-4F58-8B1D-CCBE0CD49EBB][papers]]

Finds that there is a structure they call "influence paths", that exists between gates in a LSTM that incorporates how different words relate to one another, such as the number agreement task
