- Karim and Beardsley, “Explaining Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Peacekeeping Missions.”

- Uses the composition of peacekeeping troops along two dimensions - proportions of women and the records of gender (inequality) in the contributing countries to track for sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA)
- mission level information from 2009 to 2013 indicates that higher levels of female peacekeepers and personnel from countries with better records of gender equality is associated with lower levels of SEA allegations
- 2015 office of internal oversight services released a report that made headlines
  - SEA hinders [[id:EA3D0FA6-D3E6-4497-8C42-C082F27653FC][UNSCR 1325]]

- proclaims to study this "in depth"
- Nordas and Rustad find that SEA is more frequently reported in situations with lower levels of battle-related deaths, larger loperations, and more recent operations, in ops where the conflict involved high levels of sexual violence
- they find that gender norms on the representation of women within the coutnry is inversely correlated with SEA allegations
- some evidence that the representation of women in peacekeeping missions helps shapes the SEA allegation counts
- interesting that the models are all intra-country and not inter-country
