* Bourdieu Influences
  - Uses the key analytical concepts of 'field' and 'capital'
    - Field is what comprises society, society is made up of various autonomous social microcosms
      - Political field -> is this dominated by secular nationalism or islam umma?
      - Bureaucratic/administrative field -> politicans play here
    - Capital is what people can deploy to contest a field
      - Economic capital
      - Social capital -> extent of one's network
      - Cultural capital -> Culture's stratifying power in society
      - Symbolic capital -> "It is the struggle for symbolic power within Iraq's political field that has the main explanatory focus"
        - Symbolic power legitimize power relations -> writers, teachers, journalists weild symbolic capital

* Arab Nationalism
  - Post mandate
  - Largely formed to drive the british out
  - British actually re-invaded after 1941 and stamped this out
  - Social capital was fracatured between senior military and Baath party post 1958 coup

  - [[id:6F62AAA8-8FE6-495C-A9A4-00CCC6AF62D2][abdul karim qasim]] helped solidify the Iraqist place within the political field
  - [[id:64817B58-ADF7-4FEE-83D9-255D9D87194B][Baath]]'s seizure of power in 1968 shut out the communists, and reinterpreted iraqists for itself
    - "Mesopotamianism"
