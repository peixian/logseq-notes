- 10 days in the woods
- hands on, even with covid (although people started to lean away from the covid precautions)
- very interesting dynamics, interesting age spread
  - old people >50, many kids, only a few in the middle age range
  - definitely more variety too, from camp councilors to EMT's
- group dynamics were interesting as well, people tended to partner up
- night sessions were interesting
- learning was not that hard, college course level
