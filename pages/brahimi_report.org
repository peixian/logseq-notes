Large report on how the UN [[id:F5E4DB32-6C85-47E2-AC7F-759544D1422C][un department of peacekeeping (DPKO)]] operations need to be changed in light of recent conflicts

"In 2000, the Brahimi Report proposed important doctrinal changes. The document suggested a cautious move from the narrow, Cold War inspired objectives of national security to the broader, post Cold War inspired ambitions of collective human security (Peou 2002: 51). Rather than perceiving people as citizens of particular states, the philosophy underlying human security regards all human beings as part of a global, state-transcending, community." (Blocq 2006:205)
