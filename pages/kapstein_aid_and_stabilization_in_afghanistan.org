- Causal relationships between projects and outcomes, possiblity of reverse causation or many of the omitted variables
- Authoritative and quantitive studies impossible
- modest improvements over time, massive regional variation
- violence remains and few programs have had significant impact on it

- substantial evidence that USAID stabilization programs in  had small but positive short term impacts
- long term impacts unclear
- dynamic "hot" conflict environments makes measurement very difficult
- unclear correlation between violence and aid
- almost all studies show the effects are short term and transitiory
  - for both civilian and military led projects
#+begin_quote
That physical security itself is a key determinant of successful program implementation, and sustainability complicates assessments of the independent impact of development aid on security as an outcome. 4 This is particularly salient when considering how integrated many potential insurgents were in the general community. Indeed, broader studies find that humanitarian assistance in conflict settings does not have uniform effects and that the impact of violence on changes in civilian attitudes depends on whether the perpetrator is viewed as part of their in-group.

- literature is diveided on the desirability of short term vs long term
  - short term pros
    - sets up foundations to build upon
    - easier to manage
    - less prone to corruption
    - large programs split into many small projects is useful
      - [[id:6596B9DE-6A94-4A62-AD86-A36E1CF47766][national soldiarity program (NSP)]]
  - short term cons
    - breeds dependency
    - fails to address structural problems
      - tends to replace government capacity rather than grow it
  - large projects
    - inflated expectations
    - largely failed and suspectiable to corruption and violence
- military presense is useful for establishing basic security parameters, but diminishing returns around
