    - Gives a unified chain of command
    - Managable span of control
    - Establishes common terminology

** Incident Action Planning

*** Managable Span of Control
    - Refers to number of individuals that one supervisor can manage effectively during an incidient

*** Comprehensive Resource Management
    Entails:
    - Resource identification
    - Qualification and certification of personnel
    - Planning for resources
    - Acquiring, storing, and inventorying resources

*** Establishment and Trasnfer of the Chain of Command
    - Command function should always be established at the beginning of an incident
    - Transferring command during incidient should include a briefing that captures all essential information

**** Unified Command
     - Established when there are multiple agencies, where no single jurisdiction exists that has the authority to manage the incident on its own

**** Chain of command
     - Allows incident comander to direct and control the actions to avoid the incident
       - Q-> snafucatchers?
