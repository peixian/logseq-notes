Convolutions is applying a filter to an input that results in an activation, such as with [[id:D010B569-6F86-4109-A6CD-5FB0B6D97E70][convolutional neural networks (cnn)]]

For ml, a convolution is a linear operation that involves the multiplation of a set of weights with the input

- for [[id:D010B569-6F86-4109-A6CD-5FB0B6D97E70][convolutional neural networks (cnn)]]
  - the filter is smaller than the input data and is mulitplied by the dot product
    - smaller is intentional, allows the filter to be reused across multiple places in the image
  - if we design the filter to detect a specific type of feature, then this can be discovered anywhere in the image (aka translation invariance, checking if the feature is present rather than where it was present)
