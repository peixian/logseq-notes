* Three states
- waiting
- running
- terminated
  - use kubectl describe


* Terminating Gracefully
  - Cleanups?
  - Resources?
  - Forced termination?
  - SIGTERM/SIGKILL
  - Lifecycle
    1) Set the grace period -> terminating state -> traffic
    2) preStop hook -> grace of 2 seconds
    3) send SIGTERM to pid 1
    4) grace period sends SIGKILL
    5) API server deletes the pod's API object

* Health Probes
  - Kubelet brings up the containers and keeps them running, also responsible for restarts
  - uses some Process Health Checks to check the status
  - Stalls?
  - Types of probes
    - Exec
      - Runs every so often, checks for the exit code
    - TCP socket
    - HTTP get
  - Liveness Probes
    - Check if the container is alive or dead
    - Always define a liveness probe for prod apps
    - Have the application expose a health-check API that doesn't require auth
    - Keep probes light as CPU resources
  - Readniess Probes
  - Startup probes
    - Indicates whether the container has started
    - Disables other probes until this is done

* Hooks
** postStart hook
   - Runs after container is created, async
   - No guarantees of running
   - postStart is a blocking call
   - container remains in Waiting until the handler completes
** preStop
   - Call sent to container before terminated
   - use when reacting to SIGTERM
   - always ends before SIGKILL is sent
   - used for graceful termination
** initContainers
   - runs various preconditions before the container startup
   - exaples
     - DB, create user accounts, DB migrations
** Scheduling and resources
   - Effective request/limit is the max(sum request/limit for all the application containers, effective request limit)
* Init vs postStart hook vs Startup Probe
  - Probes and hooks run in the same container, init containers run on the whole pod
  - hooks have no guarantees
  - usages:
    - postStart
      - signal to external listeners
    - init
      - initalization
    - probes
      - slow starting containers
