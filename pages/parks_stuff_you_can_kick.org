Infrastructure as a medium for understanding things
- explores "media infrastrucutres"
  - actual signals, which cables are private, etc
  - what is the stuff you can see, what is the stuff you can kick?
    #+begin_quote
  "integrated ciruits" or as part of the biotechnical or technosocial formations
    #+end_quote
    - what does this even mean
  - asks us to think about what infrastructure is made of and how they arrived
- distinguishes between mail sorters, power poles, and satellite dishes
