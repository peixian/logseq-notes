- Jihad/security studies tends to fetishize doctrine
  - we take these orientialist views because we view these things as foriegn
  - these people adopt a different universalism, therefore we view it from first principals rather than viewing as a social element
  - why do we adopt a sociological view of ourselves but doctrine based of others?
- is fiqh the correct mode of analysis? can everything be read through fiqh?
- islamic financing
  - we should look at the social elements of it
  - less studied because of relatively curious nature of it
- Talal asad
- UN peacekeeping fetishization on rote practice of human rights and protection of civilians without teaching it
What is doctrine? What are the correct universalities? Is there a universality?
