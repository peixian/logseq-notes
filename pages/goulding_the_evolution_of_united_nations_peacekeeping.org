* Questions
  - what if we created a reserve fund for peacekeepers instead of a reserve troop list?
  - how does the six types goulding identifies prevent the reemergence of a state?
* Summary
1990's article that talks about how peacekeeping has evolved
- originally peacekeeping was loosely derived from post-WW1 siutations
- remarks that legitimacy is the UN's key identifer
- notes how [[id:1E643F52-8B76-4E7A-93B2-117255EF9DA2][unifil]] became a quasi-permanent force due to its ineffectiveness
- identifies 5 principals of peacekeeping
  - must be seen as UN lead and controlled -> concerns over legitimacy
  - must require the consent of all parties -> peacekeeping missions do not work without consent
  - peacekeepers must be impartial
  - troops are provided on a voluntary basis
  - use of force is kept to minimal
- also identifies 6 types of peacekeeping operations
  1. preventative deployment - one party requests, troops act as early warning
     - being tried in [[id:63840957-74A4-47E9-9880-C309E83F5477][macedonia]]
  2. traditional peacekeeping - monitoring ceasefires, buffer zones, etc
  3. operations to help implement a comphrenesive settlement

  5. UN replacing a collapsed state
     - [[id:1A7F8EC9-B51F-460B-A078-FCB63DEC29B7][democratic republic of the congo (DRC)]] in the 60's
  6. ceasefire enforcement - similar to 2, but with force
     - vance-owen plan for [[id:4A892609-EEF5-441D-92CD-0330210D954F][bosnia]]
     - [[id:87480B74-4E7F-485F-988B-EC8CC559F15F][somalia]]

- goulding points out that funding is always a problem
- goulding argues for a more codified rules of usage of force
- greatest tool of the UN is credibility and legitimacy, thus the sec gen cannot deploy force to all places, but also must not appear overty cautious
