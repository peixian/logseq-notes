- Similar to [[id:C055CC5D-858C-4E97-9A32-861905EC2B45][Hooker - The Hardware Lottery]]
- makes the point that "compute >> clever"

* Discussion
- Role of open source
- Rise of intermediate representation
  - abstract interpretation?
- active learning and weak supervision
- malloc and fpga
  - performance constraints of cache misses?
  - cache analysis?
- compilers
  - text/stack/heap
  - isa maps to blocks of code
  - profile guided optimizations to burn in your hot spots
- what other types of machine learning are being foreclosed because we don't have the hardware?
  - what can we do?
    - can we invest in IR's?
      - FPGA's, ML IR, compiler IR's
    - reconfigurable network in datacenters
- capsul neural networks
- log file system (ssds)
- polynomial error correction -> needs eponetnial speedup
