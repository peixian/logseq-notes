* Principals
  1. /respect des fonds/ - Reliance on Provenance
     - Assumes that records have orginalized from purposeful organized activity and have relationship to one another
     - Records should be kept within the same order they arrived, allowing sets to be reviewed in totality
     - Unique quality of documents arise from the relation to their source
  2. /respect pour l'ordre primitif/ - Respect for the Primitive Order
     - Documents should not be reordered
     - A series was constructed with reason, and the series order itself is a document
     - Each record is a part of an organic whole
