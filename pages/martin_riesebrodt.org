- Contests [[id:2D1182A8-F06B-4E3A-BC2B-5BA30C8C90BF][Asad - Formations of the Secular]] on his denial of the concept of religion
- Uses a perspectivist approach that he calls 'referential legitimation'
- Through competition, borrowings, identifications, and syncretisms, religion gets recgonized as religion by its religious peers
- Agrees with the [[id:4C8F7C01-8A9A-41D2-A99E-5F594D261F14][Durkheim]]ian point of view that religion is a response to crisis, contingency and the limits of human capacities, and the sacrality of society is of limited generalizability.
