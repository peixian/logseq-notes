- 1960's - pattern matching and rules, unrealistic expectations
  - very large systems attempting symbolic representations
- 1970's-80's - linguistically rich, logic-driven systems, labor-intensive successes on few narrow tasks
  - working dialogue systems
  - heavily engineered for specific domains
- 90's-20's - statistical revolution, machine learning becomes a central part of nlp
- 2010's - deep learning takes off and accelerates progress
  - 2018-2019 - new surge of progress on unlabled data

- result, progress is very fast, months to one year on lead times
  - -> focus on metalearning, how to learn quickly
