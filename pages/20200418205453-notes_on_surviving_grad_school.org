- Must extend the boundaries of human knowledge and convince people that you have
- First take classes to figure out where the boundaries are
- _Finding a problem to solve is rarely a problem itself. Every field is brimming with open problems. If finding a problem is hard, you're in the wrong field._
- That's why I recommend that new students start a blog. Even if no one else reads it, start one. You don't even have to write about your research. Practicing the act of writing is all that matters.
  - Write, write write!
