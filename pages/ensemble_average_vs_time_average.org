Both properties of [[id:26C17B53-BBB8-49B6-A5D7-D955CFC7006B][stochastic process]], ensemble average is effectively the expected value, whereas the time average is a strict random variable.

Time average of a stochastic process is simply the average value of a single outcome of a stochastic process.

Modern [[id:85CCE0EB-E358-4A63-A947-423CF92D79A2][economics]] tends to conflate these and use ensemble averages when a time average is probably better.
