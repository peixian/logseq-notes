"Signficance filter" means only focusing on statistically significant results, which means that it can lead to an overestimation of the magnitude of the parameter.

Attempts to study this from a [[id:9052F935-3F34-463B-B185-A8666C191341][bayesian]] perspective, shows that the

the  relativebias of the magnitude is a decreasing function of the power and thatthe usual confidence interval undercovers when the power is less than50%.   We  conclude  that  failure  to  apply  the  appropriate  amount  ofshrinkage can lead to misleading inferences.

Basically only focusing on statistically significant data means that the intervals are poorly estimated, since the significance filter is a step function
