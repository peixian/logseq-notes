* Summary
Argues that [[id:E900796C-250A-474B-9054-C0C109C94A24][ddr]] can be seen through rebel groups with their command structure and financing

Posists two axes:
|                          | Formal  Command Structure | Informal  Command Structure |
|--------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------|
| Community Based Resource | CPN-Maoists               | Thubactis Battlaion         |
| Resource Based Resource  | FARC-EP                   | AUC                         |

- Notes that relationships between group's internal structure and DDR trajectories have not been studied


* Previous research
  - Civil wars did not account for heterogenity of non-state armed groups until quite late
  - Several factors
    1. frequency and severity
    2. economic drivers
    3. onset
    4. duration
    5. outcomes
    6. peacemaking negotions
  - Paper used
    - recruitment strategies
    - rebel governance
    - economic models for group formation
    - prevalance of child soldiers
    - the strategies behind violence against communities
    - fighting tactics
    - pre-war social networks
    - role of gender
    - persistence of small and lightly armed guerilla groups

* Command Profile and Economic Profile
  - Comand profiles can be driven by terror or internal organization
  - Quasi-judicial processes can enforce greater cohesion, leading to lower levels of uncertainty
    - [[id:0E683482-1AA6-4DE1-9C07-4F52F96CAEDE][maoist fighters in nepal]] did this, were able to prevent from going back to war despite long term reintegration being stalled
  - terror caused by individual groups can lead to higher levels of uncertainty, ruling through fear
    - [[id:13A519A6-B219-48AD-A9AB-836095AC819D][autodefensas unidas de colombia (AUC)]] did this

- Financing can be either predation on the local community, which leads to higher levels of organizatoin, or resource-extractive based, leading to lower levels of coordination
