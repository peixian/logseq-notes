  - /So, selfishly, I tend to think this way: if 90% of what I’m doing today won’t help me in the next job, then I should either reduce that 90% (for example, by focusing on general-purpose ideas, systems, abstractions, technologies), just not care as much about that 90% (as I used to), or find a job where I’m willing to sacrifice that 90% of my time because I think the cause is really important or the money is so.../
