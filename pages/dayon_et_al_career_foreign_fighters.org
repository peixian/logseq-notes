* Talk
  - Career FF's have an outside impact on the conflicts they go to
  - Typically bring in transnational links
  - Conflicts that lack a credible threat of genocide typically have harder time drumming up FF's
  - Career FF's are greater security threat than non-career ones
  - Limited window of opportunity for inhibiting FF's
    - Some conflicts produce more
      - This effect is hard to disentagle from the time since the war, however
  - Some FF's have come with a letter of recommendation
  - No single individual profile of FF's
