* Hosbawn 1992:
- Nationalism with political theory
- Ethnicity with socialism
* Notes
- Ethnic groups do not have a strict political order
- Constructions typically emphasize the boundaries between them

- Disaster Nationalism

* Pitfalls
  - There is a risk of not taking the violence of actors seriously
    - Difference between the categories of analysis and categories of practice
  - Extremely risky to dimiss the agencies of actual actors
  - Mahmoud Mamdani - Political violence in africa is a continuation of colonial rule
