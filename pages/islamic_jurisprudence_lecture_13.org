    - are the ulama overrepresented?
  - he focuses on Bakhit
    - ulama are proclaimed as the discourse of
  - bakhit in adopting the modernist epistimes, is no longer a frame of islamic law
  - discursive tradition of asad as a madhab
    - thinking in the terms of mcintyre is describing if we open the doors that wide
    - is the tradition "sharing the rules of the game" - legal typology?
  - is the "social madhab" a convincing one?
    - social institution
    - what is the inverse of the social madhab?
      - grants the ulama a way to tackle the reformists
      - he constrats it with the interpretive madhab
      - the madhab is still important as a form of solidarity
      - but continuing to partipate in the framework makes it so that you're not constrained by the same predecessor interpretive structures
    - is the network of the interconnected scholars distinctively hanafi?
      - or do they claim hanafi "traditions"
  - bakhit's trans-regional-ness, is that grounding or expanding the
    - practical colonial questions that needed to be solved
- chapter 2
  - foregrounding between Rida and Bakhit
  - bakhit in the 1906 debate takes rida back
  - is this new temporality a historical conciousness that emphasizes prophetic tradition, and pushes aside the medivil accretions
  - genuine novelty requires completely new ijtihad
    - what happens with the passage of time?

- chapter 3
  - dichotemcy between science and religious scholars dissolved after the early period
    - bakhit's portrayal and his narrative
  - incorporating islam to the prevailing scientific theories of the day?
  - no other time where scholars would have to confront scientific theory and have to incorporate it into jurisprudence
  - what is this chapter doing in the book?
    - are we tired of the centrality of the state?
  - seduction of modern science -
    - notion of semmetry that is not attainable
- chapter 4
  - objective reality that bakhit believes, and that this can be known through scientific means, this is a change of how fiqh was perceived
  - what was the characterization of western science?
  - is science and qiyas very far apart?
- chapter 5
  - semioitics of religion
  - reconceptualizing religious matters to not needing to be verified
  - new notions of secular and religious
  - din/dunya dichometcy
  - what consitutes as din-ni is not adjudicatble in the court of law
- using madhab as an organizing principle for islamic tradition
