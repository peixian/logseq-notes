#+TITLE: rights of hashd members

Tags: [[id:0AE7D45A-DA37-40AE-A5CD-AEB6694E810D][Knight et al - Honored, Not Contained]]

- Large part of historical problems - cannot tell who is formally enrolled as a hashd member
  - Some people claim to be under hashd, not formally authorized by the hashd comission
- patchwork entry process and unification lead to this ambigious membership
  - [[id:35846680-D69C-4C80-9494-F3375E5DDC93][asa'ib ahl al-haqq (aah)]] and [[id:F56A8565-CED0-45C2-A53B-B186DF72A1C9][kataib hezbollah (kh)]] were already active, along with [[id:BEBC4923-27A5-4FA0-8EC6-F1CB9632AA26][sons of iraq]]
- Jan 2020 - >160,000 members of the hashd according to [[id:5066CAA4-A73A-4F48-8535-C71B388E8504][abu ali al-basri/adnan ibrahim al-najjar]]
* Fighter Registration
  - Initial registration started in late 2014 and was on temporary rolling contracts
  - Hashd fighters had no clear expectation of permanent employments
  - Volunteers were haphazardly placed into units, with little influence, units would take new volunteers
    - Initially 90 day contracts
    - no ID cards or biometrics - [[id:EE01C721-DAE5-435E-A9E0-C4367F69C288][iraqi ghost militias]]
  - registration windows swapped constantly between reigstered and unregistered
    - salaries were often distributed and redistrubted between registered and unregistered fighters
  - unit commanders had almost complete discretion on how to disburse the money with few accountability
    - often 30% skimmed on salaries as "unit funds"
* Right-sizing and Auditing
  - 2016 - ~122k registered with maybe 40-50k unregistered
  - [[id:95DA0D77-6FC2-4BD5-9C16-20B037DCB31E][haider al-abadi]] wanted to audit all claimed registered individuals and record names and personal identification
    - hawiyah
    - shahadat al-jinsiya
    - bataqat al-sakan
    - al-tamwiniya
    - also biometrics (photos and fingerprints)
    - abadi ended up failing twice
  - 2018 - hashd finance director [[id:F159A5EE-A701-4C1D-8391-C88B919924C0][qassim dahif al-zubaidi]] assassinated
    - may 12, 2018 - iraqi election law actually requires security forces to vote before the public does (so that they can be on site to preotect the elections), but the hashd voted the same time as the public in theri own bases
* Biometrics
  - Iraqi gov slowly moving towards a tawtin al-rawatib ("settling of salaries" -> automated payment system)
    - idea was to distrupt the commander based disembursement model
  - March 25, 2019 - [[id:8B3339F5-33B9-4D86-AC83-C5991BC9A044][hussein ismail khalil]] announces fingerprinting and enrolled 80k/160k by March 2019
    - many hashd still paid with cash, those with widows and disabilities are testing electronic payment system
      - [[id:9F01C356-CFE7-48FA-A0E2-750CF1F1DF3B][qi cards]]
  - payments are still authorized by the [[id:9E5E0478-4353-45D3-A480-0AED0A7AD64B][hashd commission]]
* Registered and Unregistered
  - Large gulf between units in terms of registered/unregistered #'s
  - [[id:F56A8565-CED0-45C2-A53B-B186DF72A1C9][kataib hezbollah (kh)]] and [[id:BC40CBC8-81AC-4CFD-8121-7419EC9CB63B][badr]] control the key administrative posts
  - [[id:F8A39FFF-405C-4AA9-A869-745C9BA8F153][hisham al-hashimi]] states that around 24k unregistered people were serving in the hashd, or ~17.7% (159k total)
    - [[id:8B3339F5-33B9-4D86-AC83-C5991BC9A044][hussein ismail khalil]] said there is nearly 160k in march 2019

* Military Service and Retirement Rights
- [[id:F643CE85-DE07-4F56-B49E-8439D1479B34][executive order 85 (2018)]] was the clearest statement of rights
- Until 2018, hashd fighters were paid less than other ISF members
  - junior pay was between 600k to 800k dinars per month
  - equalized in 2019, now 1.1 million dinars (~$923) per month for junior volunteers, and more for higher ranks and men with families
- some hashd receive less because of unit taxing their fights by up to 30%
  - some may be spreading the pay out between registered and unregistered
  - some sunni tribes have not been paid in two years due to holdups
  - lack of continous payment drives illicit activities
- hashd has continually had "better" leave policies
  - ISF members service in rotations of 20 days on, 10 off
  - hashd units can serve as little as 10 days on, 10 off
    - hashd members have also stepped away to fight in [[id:BE234E49-5E49-4054-8308-6EDDCA766FAB][syria]] while getting paid
- hashd regularly flout the promotion requirements
  - no hashd member has ever attended professional military educational courses
  - iraqi law also provides for out-out
- retirement, martyrdom, and incapacitation laws only loosely apply
  - some have noted that martydom benefits are harder to secure for non-muhandis groups
- hashd initially used local hospitals but this proved too disruptive
  - hashd now developing field hospitals, 30 basic by Jan 2018, although poorly equipped and lacked supplies
  - seriously wounded fighters may be sent to [[id:5E8A9793-6DE6-4E2C-A33B-D85714A3C06C][iran]] or [[id:D4B35C6D-544A-481C-B5C0-7C2A2ABCF9AC][lebanon]] for urgent or long-term care

* Training and Equipping the Hashd
- now specific commitment about training, education, or equipment of the ISF personnel
