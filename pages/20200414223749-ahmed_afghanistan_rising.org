CUP officiers arrived in early years of Afghanistan under Aman Allah, where they played a major role in early "moderization".

Presents a very rosy Pan-Islamic view of the CUP officiers.

* Aman Allah
- Greatly respected [[id:56E74CD3-17D3-467F-A8CD-A8C3B8563573][mustafa kemal]]
- Configured the early Afghan state
- Multiple leaps in early [[id:CC0EFB92-1661-4A5A-BE0D-46FB07D94241][jurisprudence]] in afghanistan, such as:
  - oversight of a constitutional draft committee comprised of jurists and theorists and members of the [[id:4E2288E7-DD5A-4A6B-A795-B9A3481011FA][ummah]]
  - All laws drafted under the first constitutional committee required a match with [[id:6D1614AE-5942-4FAA-A20C-F50C09327993][sharia law]] before passing to Aman Allah
- Later years hampered by aggressive spending, eventually ousted in 1928
