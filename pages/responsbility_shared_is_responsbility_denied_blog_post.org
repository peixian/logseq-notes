Responsbility shared is responsbility denied
- consensus seeking leads to harmonization of ideas
- infatuation with "metrics"
- international organizations in peacebuilding, workroom tickets with jira and OKRs and KPI's, and research overall, it blinds us towards better software building
- all good software is done with a dictator style
- better when you put your own neck on the line
