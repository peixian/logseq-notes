- Simić and O’Brien, “‘Peacekeeper Babies.’”
- Strategic strategy began to be adopted in 2008 on the status of sexual abuse in peacekeepign missions
- argues that the UN policy fails to distinguish between sexually explotive and consenual relationships
- first allegations of sexually explotive peacekeepers were from Mozambique, [[id:4A892609-EEF5-441D-92CD-0330210D954F][bosnia]], [[id:F5EE30FC-CAAD-4D58-8AC6-087E4060E7B1][cambodia]], [[id:87480B74-4E7F-485F-988B-EC8CC559F15F][somalia]], as well as west africa
- lack of reporting has hindered clear distinction of what forms sexual explotiation and abuse has taken
- UN began to address SEA in 2002
- explores the consequences of peacekeepers in the host state wrt to sexual relationships engaged while in the mission
  - then turns to the case of Marko Susnja - a boy fathered and abonded by a Bosnian peacekeeper
