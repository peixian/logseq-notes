- "Container runtime"
- below docker and kube
- above runc, Kata, Firecracker, gVisor
- Extensible resource manager
- originally built up alongisde docker
- new interface for managing containers and images
- most memory efficient and stable
- most stuff flows through the core
- communicates with grpc
* CRI
  - Two grpc services
  - image and runtime
  - responsible for defining the pod and all cgroups
  - invokes CNI after the first container is created
* Resource management
  - current
    - CPU manager in kubelet
    - strange, difficult to use
  - NRI
    - kubelet abstraction is too blurry
    - hook into container lifecycle is the correct way
    - dynamic topology and cpu pinning with NRI
* Runtime
  - Starts up new runtime shims
    - OCI runtime shims
      - runc/kata/Firecracker
* Plugin System
  - OCI spec outlines how to run a unpacked filesystem bundle
    - tar/gzip + overlayFS + runC
  - containerd makes external plugins as backend
** Generic image layer support
   - OCI image layer described the media type
** ShimV2 for runtime implementation
   - First class shim API
* Arch
  - Shim has the most state
  - API and client have the least state
  - 1.4 is the most recent release
