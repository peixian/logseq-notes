* Notes
  - Taqwim al-Nil ([[id:B1E26B6E-6A74-4E81-8A49-B18EF81BFDAE][DiCapua - Gatekeepers of the Arab Past]]) is a sign of this type of modernizing thinking
  - Argument:
    - The construction of the Aswan Low/High Dams, alongside the Hindiya and Kut barrages, was a time of technomodernity that ultimately failed to respect the locals.
      - Construction of the Aswan Low Dam would "modernize" the locals
      - Construction of the Hindiya barrage would

* Kut Barrage
  - Constructed in 1934, opened in 1939
    - War prevented actual usage via the Dujayla land project until 1945
  - Feeds into the Gharraf Canal
    - Leads into the Dujayla Land Project
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Gharraf_River

  - Did not account for salination within the soil!

* Hindya Barrage
  - [[id:6FFF6AC2-FE18-4EB6-BFC4-50EAF67E45B4][hindyia barrage]]
  - Constructed in 1911, opened in 1913
  - Superceded later
  - Constructed by William Willcocks
    - Literally the same guy who did the Low Aswan Dam

* Low Aswan Dam
  - Aswan Low Dam
    - Constructed in 1899
    - Opened in 1902
    - Raised in 1907-1912
    - Raised again in 1929-1933

  - Did not account for salination within the soil ([[id:C14B837B-5884-4E98-B0AD-1999D65AC180][Cook - The Aswan Low Dam and Modernizing the Nile]]
  - Did not respect the usefulness of the Nile overflooding for fertilization
* High Aswan Dam
  -
* Meeting with Jim on irrigation research
  - Dumb question: why does the historiography matter?
    - Reading essay on why the orientalist perceptions, but having a difficult time squaring why that it matters
  - I have all these resources
  - How do we square notions of modernity (as in what we consider to be modern either by orientialist perspectives or not)
  - Two main points:
    - obsession with history (philae, babylon, etc)
    - lack of care about disease and salination (because it mostly affects the people and not infectious)
  - Disease and salination are both extremely common throughout all these projects, why was it not brought up?
    - Beacuse these affect the people and not the workers nor their ideals
    - Why should I care?

  - What is modernity?
* Outline
** Current Literature
   - Dams are notably signs of modernity
     - High aswan dam is a proud symbol of the egyptians
     - Many myths abound
       - Tennesse Vally Authority
       - "Dams were the modern temples of india"
         - Fusion of modernist development theory
         - Another former british colony
       - Nasser
       - King Ghazi's visit to the Kut barrage

   - state of irrigation within egypt
   - state of irrigation within iraq
   - Environmental concerns were not typically considered before 1975
   - Water resources focal point for environmentalists
   - Aswan Low Dam and Hindiya barrage were driven by part of the pre-ottoman
     - more "benevolent" type of damming, meant to benefit the egyptians/iraqi's themselves
   - Aswan High Dam and Kut Barrage were both driven by part of the post-ottoman
     - more utlitlarian types, driven by external resources
     - trace developmental modernity via these things

** Discussions
   - talk about the history of the low aswan dam and hindiya barrage
   - Low aswan dam and hindiya barrage are both scoped to within a specific historical frame aimed towards the peoplee
   - talk about history of the aswan high dam and the kut barrage
     - aswan high dam
       - product of cold war
       - failed to see impacts on fisheries
     - kut barrage
       - product of dujayla project
     - both of these exist as types of modernity described by [[id:2EBAA08C-FB3A-43F4-9411-EEC9EFF8861F][Humanism in Ruins - Discussion Questions]]
   - High aswan dam and the kut barrage are both scoped
   - Most literature on the subject is down on dams but fail to give methodological assestments of why they are down on dams
     - focus on the historiographical particularities

   - "hindia" and "hindiya"
   - "aswan" and "Assuan reservoir"
   - mosquitos in bengal and mosquitos in egypt

** Questions to ask and answer:
*** How does the topic fit into the larger context?
    - What was before irrigation projects, what was the impetus?
    - Why specifically irrigation projects?
    - What changes did irrigation projects bring to locals?
      - City of Aswan
      - Kut barrage
    - How and why were irrigation projects part of colonialism and nationalism?
      - Sources of legitmacy
        - Kut barrage and King
        - Aswan High Dam and Nasser
    - What does it mean to live in a post-ottoman/de-ottoman egypt vs an ottoman/british iraq?
    - How and why were these dams built?
    - What does this mean for British influences vs American ones?
      - Low Aswan Dam & Hindiya Barrage - British influenced
I      - Aswan High Dam & Kut barrage - American/cold war influenced
    - What does this mean for the positions of Iraq and Egypt during the building of these dams?
*** How is the topic a functioning part of a larger system?
    - How do irrigation projects reflect the colonial desire for modernization?
    - How do they reflect the nationalist desire to achieve a certain status?
    - What roles do irrigation projects play in the environment?
    - What technocratic problems are solved by irrigation?
      - Broken canals
      - Crop rotation
      - etc
    - What technocratic problems are proposed but not seen by irrigation?
      - Schistosomiasis?
*** How does your topic compare & contrast with topics like it?
    - Other irrigatoin projects within post-colonial states?
*** How has your topic changed through time? Why? What's its future?
    - How has irrigation in Egypt/iraq changed?
*** How do the parts of your topic fit together as a system?
    - How and what does the low aswan dam mean for de-ottomanization?
    - How and what does the hindiya barrage mean for ottoman twilight/young turks?
    - How and what does the High Aswan Dam mean for Nasserism?
    - How and what does the kut barrage/dujayala land project mean for post-independence iraq?
*** Turn your questions into negative ones
    - Why and when have irrigation projects not captured nationistic/independent ideas?
    - How do irrigation projects not differ from other public works?
      - Electrification
      - Industrialization
        - Why was egypt not electrified or industrialized for the production of cotton?
        - Why specifically the low aswan dam? What was the draw?
*** Ask speculative questions
    - What if there were no irrigation projects?
    - What does the propgation of the Dujayla model mean for iraq?
      - What other projects have followed?
*** Ask questions that reflect disagreements
    - Mitchell claims the modernizatoin projects hurt the Egyptian well-being, but I believe irrigation projects are not a de-facto bad, but rather prusued under a primordialist agenda almost always lacks specific understandings
*** Ask questions that build on an agreement
    - Pursely claims that the propagation of the dujayla model built upon the failures of the dujyala project. I believe the seeds for this were sown much earlier
*** Ask questions analgous to those others have asked about similar topics
    - Electrical palestine & waste seige tackle how public works projects are a sign of a nation's well being. The common complaints about the beirut trash riots are an example of this. What does the analysis of irrigation projects mean for the conventions of nationalism?
** Questions being answered
   - Irrigation vs electricity & trash, how irrigation projects reflect upon nationalism
   - Irrigation as a source of legitmacy
     - Nasserism
     - Iraqi state foundations
   - Irrigation as a desire for modenrization
   - Irrigation as a reflection of primordialist conceptions
   - Irrigation as a reflection of what it means to be de-ottomanized, post-ottoman, and "independent".
   - Irrigation as a reflection of British perceptions vs American ones
   - Current literature understandings of irrigation
