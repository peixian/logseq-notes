Why post-structuralism matters?

We can't reduce everything into small platidutes, you can't build a single system that works for everyone, and you just need to embrace the bespoke models

People dont "hate change" -> there's meaning in what we do
You can't airlift transitional justice systems in the case of libya
War is complex, and resists the same style of interpreation
