Tags: [[id:FAD07E42-4924-452A-A438-6F6DADFAD1BE][problems and methods]]

- Talks about how slavery cannot be defined solely as chattel slavery
- Argues against the notion put out by Orlando Patterson and Bruce Hall
- Islamic forms of slavery were actually a part of the slave market that eventually turned into chattel slavery
- Chattel slavery and free people were two sides of the same coin, examples where the people were the most free (like Athens) also had the most chattel slavery
- Shift of greeks and romans from half free people to reliance on chattel slaves from outside was the emergence of the idea of freedom
- Argues that Patterson, in his attempt to find a coherent definition of slavery, overlooked many differences
  - In Islam, Mamaluks
  - In Ethopia, various other groups
- Early data about #s of slaves were largely anecdotal and basically wild guesses
- Zanj rebellion in Iraq, lead by Ali
  - Large, spartacus like revolt from Southern iraq of free people and poors
  - Lasted over 15 years
- Race based slavery was a western import, largely allowing for racialized taxonomies with colonialization
  - previously one could "become" an arab, just as you could convert to islam
- Haterin in northern Morocco
- Universal definitions of slavery is a fool's errand, too difficult to actually conceptualize
- Segregation produces a clear divide between slave and non-slave, while the dominant discourse on slavery has been defined as the meeting point of abolitionist and Orientialist
