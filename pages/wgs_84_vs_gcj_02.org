[[id:BBD06BE9-5738-4445-A252-6CA185E20CFE][gps]]

- two coordinate systems, WGS-84 is the most common, but [[id:0E21DFCA-3016-427A-965E-341DE95432B7][china]] uses the GCJ-02 system
- GCJ-02 system includes an algorithm to obfuscates the results
- there are some open source libraries to convert from one to the other
- this is why [[id:3DE83B18-1DA8-4360-896B-2706B08AC1BF][google maps]] is slightly off in china by around 50m, roads are slighty off
