* First Section
  #+begin_quote
On September 14, 2016 we announced Envoy, our L7 proxy and communication bus. In a nutshell, Envoy is a “service mesh” substrate that provides common utilities such as service discovery, load balancing, rate limiting, circuit breaking, stats, logging, tracing, etc. to polyglot (heterogeneous) application architectures.

We knew that we had built a compelling product that was central to Lyft’s ability to scale its service-oriented architecture; however, we were surprised by the industry wide interest in Envoy following its launch. It’s been an exciting (and overwhelming) 7 months! We are thrilled by the positive reception and wide uptake Envoy has since received.
