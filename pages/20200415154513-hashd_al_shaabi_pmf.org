  - /A letter published on Iraqi state media, addressed to the head of the PMF, a predominantly Shiite network of around 60 paramilitaries, says that four brigades will fall under the “command and management” of the commander-in-chief of the armed forces– a role Abdul-Mahdi currently occupies as caretaker prime minister – and not under the direct command of the PMF board./
  - /The four brigades include the 2nd, 11th, 26th, and 44th brigades of the PMF, which are all loyal to Iraq’s highest Shiite religious authority, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and not under the influence of Tehran./
