Tags: [[id:EE903E8E-E6F1-4F58-8B1D-CCBE0CD49EBB][papers]]

talks about [[id:E900796C-250A-474B-9054-C0C109C94A24][ddr]] and gives a broad overview of three generations
1. traditional DDR
   - situated for peace accords and state based
2. second generation ddr
   - responding to changing agendas for peace and security
   - developed the [[id:DE06E988-C805-48A4-973A-7128C7971835][integrated ddr standards]]
   - more human security-oriented approach, abandoned the fixed sequential steps
3. [[id:F9481EED-99A7-4478-B3A7-1D1AA3C43D2C][next generation disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration]]next
   - targets how [[id:E900796C-250A-474B-9054-C0C109C94A24][ddr]] often just ignored reintegration, or reintegration was the weakest link
   - more forceful, takes a stick over carrot approach

* ongoing challenges
- unrelatistic expectations
  - mission creep
- funding
- conduct of [[id:E900796C-250A-474B-9054-C0C109C94A24][ddr]] in 'hot' conflict situations
- transnational elements
  - how to reintegrate foreign fighters, such as [[id:3D669C14-9C67-43A0-9580-04E5EEB10849][iraq]]
- economic insecurity and haphazard reintegration
  - economic insurcity may not necessarily be the best approach
- local explotiation of ddr programming
  - national ownership focus and local targeting means its vulnerable to manipulation and abuse for local political ptronage
- respect for human rights
- monitoring and effectiveness assesment
  - [[id:E900796C-250A-474B-9054-C0C109C94A24][ddr]] programming is focused on outputs and not outcomes
- lack of political will from donors
- integration and coordination
- need for more research

* Case studies
  - [[id:116909C1-7C11-4685-84DC-5F73A187B49E][multi-country demobilisation and reintegration programme (MDRP)]]
  - [[id:DB2CC264-A435-4715-8AF6-905254C4A07A][sudan]]
    - [[id:D6F35F23-0181-44C6-91D3-035FB61DF96A][un development program (UNDP)]] implemented 4 year project from 2009 to 2012
    - long time lag between disarmament/demobilization and reintegration
    - biggest criticism was the the program was focused on delivering the seven year old agreement (Comprehensive Peace Agreement) and not on the needs of the communities
  - [[id:87480B74-4E7F-485F-988B-EC8CC559F15F][somalia]]
    - implemented in "hot" conflicts
    - former al-Shabab fighters do not want to leave [[id:E900796C-250A-474B-9054-C0C109C94A24][ddr]] facilities because they feel safe
