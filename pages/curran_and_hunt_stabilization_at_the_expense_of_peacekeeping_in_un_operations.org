Curran, David, and Charles T. Hunt. “Stabilization at the Expense of Peacebuilding in UN Peacekeeping Operations: More Than Just a Phase?” Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations 26, no. 1 (April 9, 2020): 46–68. https://doi.org/10.1163/19426720-02601001.

- Makes the case that stabilization has largely come at the cost of peacekeeping
- Stabilization has focused on propping up state authority, but this may not necessarily be the best move
  - diversion of funds
  - accusations that stabilization is "liddism", or just keeping the lid stable enough but is not moving towards durable peacekeeping
- first forms of stabilization were in [[id:16E45252-6292-4F14-BC5C-7DD9781C28B0][yugoslavia]], but [[id:3196ECF7-71C2-43FE-A065-F3984D89DD1E][kosovo]], [[id:3D669C14-9C67-43A0-9580-04E5EEB10849][iraq]], [[id:086B0579-8C85-4CE5-9E65-EB8980FB2C2E][afghanistan]] were all apart of this
- [[id:C74B700F-07D9-4F54-8532-25400C21C5D0][united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in mali (MINUSMA)]] is one of the biggest offenders, alongside [[id:7AC13DA7-5BDB-469E-AA1F-99768ACDB026][united nations multidimensional integrated stabilization mission in the central african republic (MINUSCA)]], and [[id:26B73C8E-E769-417D-8383-E17DF3E1FE9E][united nations stabilization mission in the democratic republic of the congo (MONUSCO)]]
- stabilization is largely never brought up in UN documents, but is heavily invested in by operations
- in the case of [[id:26B73C8E-E769-417D-8383-E17DF3E1FE9E][united nations stabilization mission in the democratic republic of the congo (MONUSCO)]], almost entirely about propping up the government, even human rights violations happen with the national army
- UN may be stepping back from cases of deep inclusivity
