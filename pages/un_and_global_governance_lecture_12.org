* Joseph Galtun
- IMF and World Bank - unholy trinity
-
* mali
  - coup
  - UN mandate is unrelated to the mali coup
  - sequencing in what peacekeeping should be doing and asking who is dirivng the peacebuilding process?
  - more targeted and specific interventions
  - gap between level of intervention (scale) and what it attempts to do
    - what the end state should look like
* lecture
  - vast majority of states reconstructed has been democratic state
  - seems to be an end-state in what peacebuilding looks like
  - supporting role of the UN government makes it easier on UN to shirk their responsbilities
  - shifting conflict prevention
    - moving from patching emergencies to preventing conflict from happening
* readings
  1. political barriers of conflict prevention
     - RC system
       - is this conservative?
       - runs into challenges for political reasons
       - hard to sell, people are not interested in conflicts that may or may not emerge
       - intra-state conflict has greatly surged
         - internationalized interstate conflict
  2. aspects of prevention
     - conflict prevention is more localized
     - seeking to address capacity issues
     - [[id:8432F27D-0BB5-484E-B3F6-360B0D04B91D][Cliffe: UN Peace and Security Reform]] praises the reorganization
     - managing short term priorities while also mitigating the long term risks
       - lack of respect for human rights
     - important of coalition, prevention must be a collective effort

  3. concepts:
     - prevenative diplomacy
       - narrow focus, clear trigger, works by shifting decision-making calculations of conflict actors away from violence
       - move actors away from the local and try to get a comprimise
     - structural violence prevention
       - what are the structural conditions that contribute to the onset of conflict?
       - how do we transform these structures?
       - largely solidified
  4. evolution
     - Dag Hammarskjold
     - Perez de Cuellar
     - Bourtros Boutros-Ghali
     - Kofi Annan
     - Ban Ki-Moon - restructuring
     - Antonio Guterres - prevention became THE priority
       - prevention ops is much larger, almost the size of peace operations

- when do host governments spoil peace?
- should allocations go to near term emergencies?
- been a demand for mediation experts
  - is this workable? can mediators be dispatched anywhere?
- bureaucratic misalignments in structural prevention
- reform plan from Gueterres
  - still assessing whether the decoupling has a good impact
  - prevenative diplomacy has shrunk, this has been regrowing
* questions
  - causing of funding with engagements from local actors
    - strategic frameworks is done every two years, across the board entites that recieve regular budget (aka from member state dues)
      - specific member states are very interested in funding initiatives such as gender or sexual based violence
      - existing multi-donor trust fund
        - goes hand in hand with technical assistance
        - remains to be seen if the member states
  - lots of readings focus on diplomatic solutions
    - is there a role or benefit forceful action?
    - carrot and stick strategy has no consistency
      - multidimensional peacekeeping missions in the [[id:1A7F8EC9-B51F-460B-A078-FCB63DEC29B7][democratic republic of the congo (DRC)]], in every iteration since 2006
        - issues with local actors not trusting MONUSCO
  - how much is funding involved in prevention plans? how much can be expected of the UN in conflict prevention?
    - existing trust fund
    - started to shift certain departments
    - emphasis on power sharing agreements
      - what are they modeled on?
      - liklihood of breakdown
      - nonconsolidation of democracy
  - "sustaining" is the operative word
  - dealing with the binary of peace/non-peace
    - moving to hybrid notions of how to co-opt
    - social cohesion to build "resilence", but only one layer
    - very troublesome, still powerbase driven, lack of curiosity
    - disapora - less so with the UN, focused on a statist approach
      - more promentiant on smaller NGO's
      - the UN is focused on spoilers to the peace process, not specifically power players
  - what is the role f
