* Summary
- focused on 1948
- Talks about how initially, economics was focused on tangible land
  - FDR gives a speech about no more space, and the remaining work was to be stewards of the land
    #+begin_quote
  Our industrial plant is built; the problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt. Our last frontier has long since been reached, and there is practically no more free land. . .

- Taft-Hartly used against the oil refinieries and the coal mines, and then the railways
  - Justification of peacetime use of military power that was linked to national security
    - national security act of 1947
    - new "sacred cow" for america
- creation of the CEA and the merging of economics into the gov
- requires the quantification of the future
- usage of the log "tames" the unknowable future
- leads to truman's idea that expertise was infinite
  - modernization theory/[[id:7516C9D2-C858-4B4F-8608-4610982B233B][development theory]], singular future
  - fundalmental belief that with the spread of expertise, everyone would merge into the same future
- begins to collapse with the fall of oil prices

* Additional thoughts
  - Three stages of history:
    - quantifiable present (FDR's speech, raw land), no perception of the future
    - quantifiable future, singular future, everyone would build and end up in the same spot, [[id:7516C9D2-C858-4B4F-8608-4610982B233B][development theory/structural adjustment]]
    - quantifiable possibilities, multiple futures, not everyone would end up in the same spot, but we can make money off of that ([[id:05C396C9-319D-4BA1-921A-3997FE3FC828][derivatives]], making money off of volatility)
