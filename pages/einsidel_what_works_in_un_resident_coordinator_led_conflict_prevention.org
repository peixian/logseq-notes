- Sebastian von Einsiedel, “What Works in UN Resident Coordinator-Led Conflict Prevention: Lessons from the Field.”

- Report attempts to study the success rates of conflict prevention with Resident Coordinators (RC's)
  - RC's lack an explicit mandate to engage in political activities, and usually come from humanitarian backgrounds
    - leading to them to be highly deferential to host governments

- there exists a "capacity gap" in RC offices in crisis and post-crisis situations
- human rights culture has yet to take root among UN officiers, considered "too hard"
- Sustaining peace report highlighted the responsbilities of RCs to help build inclusive societies, but member countries did not endorse this role
- One area where HQ actually leads the field, field needs to catch up
* Case Studies
- problems with RC's aside, RC preventative action does work, although RC action is not the determining factor
- finds that RC's must have potential to seize on political opportunities when they arise
  - tools to seize opportunities
    - build relationships of trust
    - maintain impartiality
    - respect the parameters of nationally-led prevention (keep a low profile)
    - have something to offer
    - make the most out of looming elections
    - if political space is constrained at the national level, go local
    - protect UN norms
    - analyze and avoid box-ticking
    - drive conflict sensitivty and get everyone to agree on the prevention flag
    - leverage other UN entities (both in HQ and the field)
