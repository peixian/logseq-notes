- Notions of memory:
  - 3 types:
    - Degredation
      - Memory degrades as time goes on
    - Lock and Key
      - Memory stays, but the key to it disappears, which is why it requires certain cues
    - Overwritten
      - Memory stays, but is overwritten by others

- Carefully design drills
  - Choose for direct practice
- Take notes as questions instead of answers to practice retrival
- Best feedback is informative and usable, but any feedback is better than none
  - Important to know which parts of feedback is useful for signals
  - Carefully and tune learning environment
- Procedural skills, such as biking, are more easily remembered
  - Turning rote learning into procedural learning is one fo the best ways to remember
  - Same with overlearning, keeps the memory for longer
- Steps for a project:
  - Metalearning:
    - Research into typical ways of learning this skill
    - Make sure to set realistic, achievable goals
  - Focus:
    - Block aside time to actually work on the skill a la [[id:7BF6C237-2C71-4875-8141-1CBC99BC750A][Newport - Deep Work]]
  - Directness:
    - Directly tackle the skill in the format you'll be using it in with similar environments
  - Retrival:
    - Is time being spent passively or actively retriving it? Can things be recalled from memory without looking at notes?
  - Feedback:
    - Is feedback honest? Is performance being improved as part of the feedback?
  - Intuition:
    - Do I understand the things I'm learning or is it rote memorization?
  - Experimentation:
    - Are new techniques being tried beyond the current resources?
