- Stabilization vs peacebuilding
  - readings put forward the binary of stabilization vs peacebuilding
    - what does "success" look like for stabilizing and peacebuilding
    - long term strategy for peacebuilding -> ends in procedural democracy?
    - long term strategy for stabilization -> restore state soverignty
      - developing human intelligence
      - "quick impact projects" -> UN country team

- penholders in sc practice stabilization in their own interventions
- create a space for political solution and reconstruction
  - military actions are politized, and the boundary between military and political activity is blurred
- peacebuilding and statebuilding are the same in stabilization
- stabilization goes beyond counter-insurgency by being interagency
