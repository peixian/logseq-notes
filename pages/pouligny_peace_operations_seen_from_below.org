Describes the case studies of [[id:19451263-FE36-4A8C-BF90-A34E7A22A5FE][el salvador]], [[id:08F6246E-666A-4770-9648-ACDD18F77530][mozambique]], [[id:F5EE30FC-CAAD-4D58-8AC6-087E4060E7B1][cambodia]], [[id:4A892609-EEF5-441D-92CD-0330210D954F][bosnia]], and [[id:87480B74-4E7F-485F-988B-EC8CC559F15F][somalia]] in the context of [[id:006AFDE2-7821-4866-AE48-0CD969B89F2D][un peacekeeping]] operations

- Battleground for how the conflict is presented on an international level
- Somalia was the first time the UN was authorized to use force in a peacekeeping mission
- Budgetary issues tends to lead missions towards short term management
- Deployments outside of Europe tend to have firm end dates
- Electoral politics is used as a landmark for UN security council
- Sometimes the UN has engaged in direct authority, such as Cambodia, East Timor, and Kosovo
- 794 Resolution: Military force under humanitarian purposes
- SC members are often more okay with intervening in places where the state no longer exists than trample on soverighty for fear of precedence
- Superimposing of east/west and urban/rural on local conflcits

* International Communities
- How the international community defines a crisis is important0
  - Permanent SC members play a role in this
- SC matintains discretion over what is and is not an emergency
- lack of consensus leads to common denominator type mandates
- Deployments are most often partial and reinforced by patrolling teams, which limits their scope
- Different staff members (civpols, civs, military) are treated differently
  - civs least likely to have contact with local memebers
  - military is most visible, but often limited
  - police are often not numerous enough
- Urban/rural divide exasterbated by the UN staff, UN staff take over a capital but are raely seen in towns
* Various Faces of Local Populations
- Blue helments often consider two parties: a "military" and a "political" one
  - This division is often nonexistent
- Peace agreements do not create peace, but give a map for who the UN will negotiate with
- Absense such agreements, parties vie to become recongized as the negotiating parter of the UN, such as in Somalia
- Local actors are not monoliths, they also evolve when the UN injects itself
- Political actors who do not play the military game or hardball the UN often get marginalized
- Bosnia's "civil" parties were shut out by 3 extreme viewpoints
- Returnees from exile also pose unique sets of questions
- Peace process sharpens the differences between the leaders and their constituants
* Indigenous Civil Societies
  - UN usually takes a very passive view of civilians
    - "refugee" idea, or "oppresive state"
  - UN actors look for structure of "civil society" that mirror the ones in the west
    - ngo, trade unions, etc
  - UN predominately interacts with Human rights orgs
    - Typically benefits diaspora
  - Both UN staff and local NGOs feel the other is difficult to work with
    - UN has massive NIH syndrome as a result
    - IGNO's are perceived to be favored by the UN
    - UN often assumes distinct "political" and "civil" realms
      - El Savador had Human rights NGO's, but as a result of the civil conditions, these NGO's inherently favored some politicans
  - False impression of "intellectuals" as unbiased mediators
  - Community interaction in rural vs urban areas
  - Strict top/down interpreations are wrong, communities constantly renegotiate their position
  - Religious actors play a special role
    - UN often drawn into local political disputes
    - Religious actors are mobilizing capacity in wars
  - Local employees as brokers
    - Missions w/ admin that have pressure exterted on them as UN employees
    - Foreign language knowledge biases the background
    - Information trading from local employees for future posts
* Peacekeepers & local socities
  - "Peace is not self evident"
    - Ambiguity between UN and local cultures provides space for political entrepenurs
  - "Blood & BOne: Kinship in Somali society"
  - Local actors perceive social change for power, UN sees it as waging for reference ideas
  - "Rule of law" is particularly thorny
    - Locals often see the gov as "not for them", and the UN missions in the same way
  - "Law" as a concept is not widely respected
    - Do locals describe the state as they describe the UN mission?
* Sizing Up the Aims of a UN Mission
  - Political actors greatly affected if the mission was deployed as part of a peace agreement
  - UN officials assume a static "peace" and worry about exaggerated hopes, but reality is locals see the UN as part of a new power struggle
  - UN in [[id:4A892609-EEF5-441D-92CD-0330210D954F][bosnia]]
    - European community percieved as hostile by Serbs
    - UN seen by Serbs to preserve the status quo
      - Bosnians interpreted the UN boundaries and limits on mandate as the limits of will of the West
        - pg 106
      - Persistent doubts about military intervention by the Serbs
    - Humanitarian mission of Blue Helmets actually forestalled direct military intervetion
    - Ambiguity opens for entreprenurs
    - ON overshadows INGOs rather than supporting them
  - UN often seen as spectators rather than actors by locals
    - Locals expect the UN to do nothing
    - UN seen as destabilizing the social order without benefits
  - Often inflated expectaions due to pre-arrival announcements
  - "Quick impact" projects - smaller, cheaper, more immediate projects often taken as a sign that the UN could do more
  - UN missions reinterpret on the ground, members constantly improvise
  - SC mandates are often messy and contradictory
    - Pressure to avoid loss of human life/resources
  - International institutions interwine and overlap, causing confusion for the locals
  - UN missions are not monolithic either, individual components clash with each other
  - UN HQ vs mission HQ
  - "Localism" via zones of responsibility
  - Missions often have impressive archives, but the decision making process is often removed from the diagnosis
  - Causes of UN mission incompetence
    - Bad to no training
    - KNowledge of actors are often not impartial
    - Information flows up but never down
    - MIssions often retreat within, hindering their progress
  - Missions target international opinion by natives
    - Mission reports are first made to the Secretariat and the SC
  - Narratives refract and reflect via foreign journos, local journos and (I)NGO's
* Soverignty and Intervention
  - Why are peacekeepers not greeted as liberators?
    - Similar: why are peacekeepers not thought of as occupying forces?
  - Locals may refer to the UN forces in colonial language
  - "Aid culture" - some countries have been flooded with aid, and percieve the UN as a continuiation of that aid
  - Political groups within countries typically engage with the UN on a local level and have conflicts with the UN, very rarely band together against the UN on a larger level
  - Rejection of the UN is rare because the UN is perceived as doing so little
  - Soldiers and violations of the local customs, especially prostitution often harms reputation
  - UN ignores rumors about its missions at its own peril
    - "We do not take them seriously because they do not take us seriously" syndrome
  - When countries emerge from conflict, main interests of the political entrepenurs differ wildly than most people
    - Which is why most demonstrations against the UN are very local
  - The UN imposes on the political arena, and cannot remove itself from that
* Strategies of Local Actors
  - Speaking with the UN conferrs legitmacy
    - More visible the UN is, the more it is sought after
  - In Bosnia, media warw as waged
  - Some NGO's derive their funding and existance completely from the UN
    - El Salvador and Haiti had local NGO's, this relationship is more unclear there
  - UN is perceived to facilitate international aid
    - When the UN is a transitional authority, the peace mission takes on an economic action
    - UN can act as a spoiler for those with previously agreed transition plans
    - Actors in Mozambique and Somalia sold their participation in the UN process, with political actors, warlords, imams, etc
  - UN staff can be percieved to be controlling aid access
    - Maifoso networks in bosnia
  - Business shifts to accomodate UN workers
    - Especially in capital
  - Overlaying the intl political map on the local
  - Looting of UN property upon withdraw
  - Local actors will "try their luck" and "keep trying"
  - Local actors will also try to force the UN into taking a side
    - Bosnian muslims routinely made things worse in hopes of attracting a military intervention
    - Local villages in Cambodia owuld cause issues to get the UN to go in
  - Implication of the UN very often land disputes
  - UN as an alibi and scapegoat
    - Easy to scapegoat UN actors
    - Local actors complain about funds, drawing together the very real issues of peace and money
  - "elections at any cost"
    - Elections seen as key milestone for success
    - Local actors recongize this, and will repeatedly threaten to bow out of elections
  - Some local political actors apply force because they may not survive the peace process
  - Delays in peace process implementation are common, difficult for the UN to admit failure
  - Looming international deadlines
* Forgotten Promises
  - UN always comes in with a set of preconcieved notions
  - Most frameworks use elections as a barometer for success
    - UN uses elections for places where it is an occupying force
  - Goals & aims of a "procedural democracy" are formed
    - Premature elections after a war actually risks stoking old fears, elections are not a quick fix
  - Eletion rigging, emphasis on security criteria dog UN elections
  - "Legitimacy", "Democracy", and UN's desired results often clash
  - International election monitoring is often conducted in a very technically oriented way
  - Elections @ any price opens ot election fraud, leading to perverse goal setting for future elections
  - Economic reconstruction only approaches it from the symptomes, does not attempt to solve the core issues
    - Peace processes often accompianed by worsening of living conditions, which sharpens conflict
  - UN missions have largely shifted from maintence of ceasefires to "policing action"
    - Policing action means intervening within the social fabric
    - Policing as a coercive tool
    - UN is often not responsible for the intial training
      - ICITAP funded by the US is
        - Similar to teacher's college in [[id:3D669C14-9C67-43A0-9580-04E5EEB10849][iraq]]? See [[id:D7A476E6-3506-4335-A5EC-12838C0F4B39][Pursely - Familiar Futures]]
    - New police blunders are often overlooked as "youthful" mistakes
    - UN missions lack local trust, local knowledge, and cannot effectively intervene on the social contract
    - Usage of force opens the possbility of a peace mission turning into an occupation
  - Judicial systems
    - Weak judicial systems contribute to the issues, UN does not attempt large-scale reforms of judicial systems
    - Reconcilation of status ("who are we as a people"/"who is the state") is often neglected in the peace process
    - Demand for justice is sacrifed for the demand for peace
      - Lacuna of history is imparted onto new generations
    - Technical expertise of the UN reduces the peace process to be without political substance
