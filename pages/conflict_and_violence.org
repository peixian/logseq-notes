* Lecture 2
 What drives violence? Why do people become violent?
** Shame: Emotions of Morality and Violence
   [[id:EE903E8E-E6F1-4F58-8B1D-CCBE0CD49EBB][papers]]
   - Shame as a motivator
     - Desire to seek basic forms of dignity
   - Compares violence to a contagious diease (undetected)
     - Not very convincing tbh, the metaphor somewhat falls flat
     - However, Bonnasse-Gahot et. al in 2005 had a study on how French riots followed a similar "contagion" model
   - Talks about how prisons have a cycle of punishment, harsh behaviors lead to harsh punishments
   - Proposes 3 conditions of violence
     1) Feel deeply ashamed of something
     2) Feel like they have no non-violent alternatives
     3) Lacks emotional capabilities at the time that inhibit the violent impulses
   - Fact note: before large scale woman's shelters, the homicide rate between men/women were about the same. After shelters, the homicide rate of husbands killing wives doubled
   - "It is difficult for many of us to abandon our moral and legal way of thinking about violence" - pg 134
     - Does this also mean we tend to interpret state violence through an inherent legalistic kind of view?
