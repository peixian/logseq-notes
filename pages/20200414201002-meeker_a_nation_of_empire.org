* Ottoman era power circuits were maintained in Trapzon
** Despite issues with Trapzon's outward Islamism people bought into the concept of a kemalist turkey


* Notes
  - Brings to light provincial governments of turkey
  - Maintains same relationships, the same pipes of power remain while shifting the actors slightly
    - Aghas replaced by large families
  - Style of emulation of central gov remains
    - "Citizens had represented an agha and hodja"
  - Interpersonal connections w/in the modern age has slightly disrupted
  - Role of women
    - Passive throughout the book, draws a parallel to the silent viziers of the ottoman empire
  - Selimoglu vs Muradoglu
  - Tea cooperative story, where Hussein sits at a large desk at the tea co-op emulating the president
  - Mehmet Bey's fall from grace due to not being engaged within the two family system
  - Familial ties remain, where nicknames stuck <--- on an anthropological level
  - Reorinetation of social structures
  - Life and death in the empire
  - Stories about the french traveling, and the mouth and organs of the central empire sets up the logical nature of recursive emulation
  - Blindness of outsiders to this recursive system, where the French/British consul was the only one would took into account this system
  - Name law, unveiling encouragement
  - Uneven application of methods: history transitions into anthropology
* Response
  - Hodjas are brought up, so much of the book is focused on Islam as a passive force, but islam actually remains one of the more consistent aspects of the region
  - Exisiting power circuits remain, but islam glues this together, rooted in some kind of islamic notion
    - Supported via the "conservatism" notion of Of (women need to be veiled)
    - Supported via the notion that Oflus are religious extremists
    - Oflus felt lost without an Imam
* Questions
  - What is the legitmate affect of Islam today within this region?
  - Ottoman is a highly loaded term, typically drawing upon the hiers of the great islamic empires
  - Shifting of turkish identity from Islam and the Ottoman house/state to an individual identity
    - Battle of Of
    - Giant mosque being built as of 1980
  - General conversion of Greeks into Islamic beliefs
