* Memory
  - Does memory provide realness to a specific identity?
  - Much of the historiography is written by Israeli authors
  - The present is interpreted through the past
  - Arab nationalis, palestinian nationalism, arab-palestinian nationalism, and the historical realities of this

* Marxist and Modernist Views of Nationalism:
** Modernist
   - Nations and nationalism are products of modernity
** Marxist
   - Nations and nationalism are products of capitalism
     - A bourgeoise is required
* Instrumentalism
  - Since ethnicity and nationalism are results of circumstance
    - Can be wielded and used by elites
    - In invoking this, they are evoked and given form
