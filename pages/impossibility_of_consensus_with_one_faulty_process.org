- FLP states that, under ths async model, there is no deterministic algorithm for consensus
- there is no way to solve the consensus problem under a very minimal system model in a way that cannot be delayed forever

- Consensus is impossible with one faulty process w/o allowing for failure dectors like local timers (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/papers/p225-chandra.pdf) or randomization (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800221.806707)
