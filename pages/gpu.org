* History of NVIDIA GPU's
  - Until 2006 GPU design was correlated to the logical stages of the rendering API
    - DirectX pipeline made this untable
  - Stream Multiprocessor replaces this with Tesla release
    - Could run vertex, fragement, and geometry kernels without distinction
  - Ideas of a "farm" with a master renderer
  - CUDA introduced as a superset of C99
  - Turing release gave dedicated cores for AI and [[id:9EE3F3DF-2E17-4F00-9C72-DBF79017AF40][ray tracing]]
    - Very reminiscent of pre-2006
