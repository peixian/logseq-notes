* New Panel Edit UI
  - 6.0 made it easy to change visualization type
    - created a lot of dead space
  - 7.0 wanted to make options more consistent and define override rules
  - "field" tab impacts all the data
    - overrides
    - bar guage
  - New transformations -> joining of timeseries
  - Cell styles, gauges
  - Much more up to date, exposing new transformation pipeline
    - data source -> panel defaults -> panel overrides -> visualization

* Transformation
  - Single place where users can tweak the structure of data
  - Takes effect for every visualization
  - Shapes the data
  - Not about doing complex arithmetic
  - Panel can reuse same data from another query, piping the data into all sorts of panels
  - Transform timeseries into columns

* Look at Raw Data
  - You can now inspect and download raw with the "inspector" in the panel manager
  - Exposes the underlying raw data

* Issues and Debugging with Queries
  - Grafana comp presentation
  - When zooming out, data no longer makes sense
    - Data rollup feature has been implemented
      - Rollup tells you when the data was being read from a rollup
      - 8 days in metric tank, for example
    - As well as "metadata"
  - Plot lines as points to debug
    - Fetching multiple series will cause some optimization, triggers it to use rollup data
  - "Stats" panel tells you how long a query took
    - "metricplan" statistics tells you how long a query works
  - Grafana can hook up to a jaeger datasource and look at it directly from grafana
  - Transforms and outer joins
  - Timezone support features
    - Transforms all graphs into a single time zone
  - Plan to support per panel, per row?
    - Not really
  - Gauages and singlestat panels have new layout engine
