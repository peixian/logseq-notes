al-Husri directed education in Iraq, promoted pan Arabism, butted heads with the Columbia teacher's college

* [[id:8830B938-A3B9-4C75-A32C-314836589F57][Simon - Imposition of Nationalism on Non-Nation State]] says:

  - Husri cited german "volk" type of primordialism, extolled the idea of pre-Islamic Arabs
  - Decided that history of Arab nation was the history of the Arabs, not of Islam
  - Bypassing of religious unity via langauge, similar to [[id:47EF592A-10D4-4923-BE86-E3E03918624D][Anderson - Imagined Communities]]
    - Arabism could then transcend religion and be accepted by Sunni, Shia, Christian, and Jew
      - Notably no Kurds
  - left in 1936 due to disagreements with teacher's college, but Muhammad Fadil al-Jamali and Sami Shawkat continued his work
  - History was used as a tool
