- Axiom schema are the framework for axioms
- Any formal system that lets you make longer theorems from shorter ones requires a decision procedure, which leads to [[id:670B0AC3-A80D-4DBE-8B4F-7B1FB74A8DA1][halting problem]]
- any constructions of an isomorphism induces meaning, because if there is a way to transform the information without losing it, then there is inherent meaning in the information
- interpretation vs meaning
  - intepretation - what the symbol represents
  - meaning - the underlying thing
- systems can take on multipl;e passive meanings
- do formal systems always need to map onto reality?
- how do we "prove" isomorphism?
- numbers misbehave, although people have an innate sense that they do not
- [[id:9CCF2FDC-4B10-4E45-8414-9D1815AD7ADB][euclid's theorem]]
- Proofs can be broken down into discontinous jumps that never make sense until zoomed out
