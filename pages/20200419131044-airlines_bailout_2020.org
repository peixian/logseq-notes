- Airlines spent 96% of free cash flow on stock buybacks
- Airline bailout is not strict
  - _For instance, some of the money is in cheap loans, and some in grants that will be forgiven if the carriers fly right_
- No minders
  - _But in a less capital-serving bailout, another problem is who the minders would be. Remember AIG? The government appointed three trustees. Thereâ€™s no evidence they did anything other than collect fees and confer a veneer of legitimacy._
- Bailout doesn't even work for all airlines, such as budget tourist ones like JetBlue
  - Very likely more bailouts are needed
