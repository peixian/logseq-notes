- [[id:42D5EA33-3EE3-4A69-BDDC-2F590D82B9FE][Bayat - Revolution without Revolutionaries]]
  - Questions
    - He makes the neoliberal claim, yet ignores the asian financial crisis of 1997
    - Places these revolutions temporally and within the same system
    - Unspoken is the "contagion" of revolutions, that it spreads
      - Is the contagion much like the finanical systems?
    - Three lessons out of the 1997 criss were:
      - dangers of sudden reversals of capital flows
      - problems of "contagion" - where crisis spread for now discernable reason
      - pro-cyclical nature of international finacnial markets
        - capital flows tend to come in during growth and overheating, exit during downturns, exasterbating swings
      - Changed how people thought about developing economies, maybe not better for them to open up
    - talks about IMF, but misses the mechanics of it
      - we elide all the bretton woods institutions into one
        - IMF failed horribly in 1997
        - World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Paris Club, private sector, CEDAR conference (to unlock lebanese money), etc
    - Thailand/laos/indonesia/malaysia were not significantly more developed than the middle east, why no revolutions?
    - I think his neoliberal frame is correct, analysis is slightly off
    - Hong Kong and Lebanon - both financial clearing houses
      - financial literacy of the lebanese, knowledge of eurobonds has dramatically increased
    - His analysis leaves out the agencies of the state, in coalesing all the "revolutions"/"refolutions" into one, he misses out on how the state responds to such a turn

  - Questions:
    - To find those realities, you have to know how to look
  - Politics
    - Polities as monorealities?
    - The praxis of politics does have an agreed upon and final answer
      -

* Revolutions
  - Revolutions as spurning forward
  - What qualifies as a "revolution"?
    - Somewhat racialized qualification
    - What enters the "halls of revolution"
  - What tools do these texts give?
  - Taking daily realities about
  - The heritage of "revolution" matters because it is self legitimizing
  - Focoult never used the term "revolution" because it was too welded to another term
