"Cartoons" affair from Dutch newspaper /Jyllands-Posten/ caused riots to break out against the Dutch embassies worldwide and lead to halted exports.

- Saunders attempts to debunk the notion that the Ummah is not a political identity
  - Ummah is clearly a political identity via Islamism
    - Sufi lodges with [[id:64151A69-C7D3-435A-9D04-9DB692D01A1D][Can - Spiritual Subjects]]
    - Exceptionalism of Islam, Balkan Christian orthodoxies were absorbed into the state, but Islam was not [[id:360914DB-207A-458E-A677-B1DC2302A2FA][Anscombe - State, Faith, and Nation]]
    - [[id:A5D510FC-AEDA-4CB2-8AFC-0CB7308ED48A][Hassan - Longing for the Lost Caliphate]] clearly shows precendence
- Muslims living in a disapora constitute a "nation on the move"
  - Similar to pilgrims or [[id:C502879F-6192-46A0-B178-E331F8607116][Blumi - Ottoman Refugees, 1878-1939]]
- This is somewhat unconvincing when he uses the "American immigrant experience"
- _Rather than trying to dominate a place deﬁned by physical territory (e.g. Leeds, Pakistan, or the Middle East), these elites are seeking inﬂuence over a space conceived around human beings (i.e. the Muslim world including its exclaves in the West), although there are certainly some groups such as Hizb ut-Tahrir that would like to see the black ﬂag of the caliphate ﬂying over London._
  - This seems out of place and ignores history, Muslims in the past have seen distinct people as focal points
- [[id:47EF592A-10D4-4923-BE86-E3E03918624D][Anderson - Imagined Communities]]'s description of "nations on the move"
- Notably unqualfied assertions of economic impact
- _Through internet-enabled virtuality and diasporic marginalisation, the ummah – more so than at any time in the past – is functioning as an ersatz nation._
