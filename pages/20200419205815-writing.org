- node for the actual act of writing

* 4 parts of writing
  - __Valuable__
  - Recongizable
  - Organized
  - Clear

* Avoid "Text based rules"
  - Avoid rules like "don't do passive writing", or "avoid jargon"
  - Avoid writing in a way that shapes the /text/
  - For every rule, ask "which reader" and "which purpose"
    - Ex: "use short sentences"
      - For which reader?
      - For what purpose?

* Expert based writing
  - Writing and thinking are usually entwined, writing helps out the thinking process
  - In the real world, the function of the text you write is /to cause readers to change what they think about the world/
    - NOT HOW YOU THINK
    - What makes text valuable is how the readers percieve how they changed how they think
