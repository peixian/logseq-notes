** Social Cohesion & Inclusivity - Ailena Sterio & Jessica C. Levy
   - Defined as
     #+begin_quote
     The complexity & multidimensionality of the force, or "glue" that holds a society together and enables its members to predicibly develop
     #+end_quote
   - [[id:D6F35F23-0181-44C6-91D3-035FB61DF96A][un development program (UNDP)]] and [[id:24F2B63F-678B-4654-BAC7-C8C80CC77EC9][search for common ground program]]
   - why?
     - can rebuild what has been torn apart
       - most post-conflict socities have a high level of mistrust, described in [[id:5915E4D5-6F4F-4B64-B435-DCA3FD99C50F][Kalyvas - The Logic of Violence in Civil War]]
     - ensures vulnerable populations no longer face harm
       - without social cohesion programs, these groups may get sidelined
     - prevents future conflicts
     - supports & rebuilds local capacity
     - new opportunities to bring in groups that were marginalized before

*** Three Approaches
**** Community Driven
     - Focuses on democratization towards local groups and partipation of communities
     - Community driven reconstruction (CDR) - focuses on rebuilding infrastructure
     - Community driven development (CDD) - focuses on improving existing infrastructure
     - Both hope to address root of conflict
**** Social Acculturalization
     #+begin_quote
     Social processes that occur in a context in which newcomers and members of the host culture are in contact with each other... and must in one form or another adapt to their new cultural environment
     #+end_quote
     - Includes separation & marginalization vs assimlation vs reintegration
     - Most literature focuses on the processes of voluntary reintegration
**** Education
     - Education can exasterbate or alleivate social inequalities or marginalization of groups
       - Killing of mother tongue
       - Ethnic divisions such as those in [[id:C8C5D0B0-C8FD-437B-AC1C-8CAD30C7D9CB][rwanda]] or [[id:75596EDC-4243-41A7-A85A-8BC334C2048C][burundi]]
       - Can also expose, teach, and find common national identity
**** Reconciliation in Total
     - Grassroots and middle range (actors who have power by network and not by position such as religious leaders, community leaders, businesspeople, etc) are most effective here
*** Common Challenges
    - Marginalized communities
      - Youth and women are often not considered, or are considered mere stage props
    - Conflict created communities
      - Refugees, IDPs and ex-combatants
      - New identities may have formed during conflict and is hard to break
    - Enduring divisions
      - [[id:4A892609-EEF5-441D-92CD-0330210D954F][bosnia]] -> communities did not want to go back to their old locations where they would be an ethnic minority
      - [[id:C8C5D0B0-C8FD-437B-AC1C-8CAD30C7D9CB][rwanda]] -> completely shattered social fabric
*** Case Studies
**** [[id:BBFDEDEC-51A6-4D99-BD64-F690D1EE8F67][nepal]]
     - social cohesion & democratic partipation program in 2016 led by [[id:D6F35F23-0181-44C6-91D3-035FB61DF96A][un development program (UNDP)]]
     - also found that violence in communities ended up brining them together, potential group violence coping mechanisms
**** [[id:F5EE30FC-CAAD-4D58-8AC6-087E4060E7B1][cambodia]]
     - [[id:581693EA-42E1-4903-9144-0D88B4012241][khmer rouge]]
     - only family bonds remained
     - minimal progress has been made in fostering social cohesion
     - existing programs have largely been top down
     - 2013 study found that cambodians continue to rely on family bonds
**** [[id:AFEF9FA6-B022-46F4-AE2B-DE70CE370215][nigeria]]
     - [[id:E2D6AA8C-685B-4E47-8B74-4EA04AA5C52E][2009 niger river delta insurgency]]
     - programs run by both civil society and IOs
     - muslim/christian divide looms large
     - IOs lack meaningful partnerships with civil society groups
*** Best Practices
    - Aim for multiple level/cross cutting approaches
      - Not just the people it targets, programs should try to bring in multiple sectors
    - Value openness and flexibility
      - Hard to establish baseline metrics
    - Build and take advantage of local capacity
      - Always identify local capacity where it exists
    - Aim for inclusivity
