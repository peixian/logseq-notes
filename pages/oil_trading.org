2 kinds of oil traders:
1. betting
2. actually taking orders


- taking oil is highly regulated and extremely expensive
- once terminals run out of space, then you are effectively at the behest of the counterparty and will pay anything to get out of the situation
- negative oil pricing impacts models like [[id:F16CD931-B631-4D77-AB5E-134EF1D9C134][black scholes]]

* Ticker Strategy
** Futures
*** Regular Futures
    - "Root Ticker" + "Month" + "Year"
    - Example: "CL" + "Z" + "2" = CLZ2, (WTI crude) expiring December 2022
*** Active Tickers
    - "Root Ticker" + "A"
    - Example: "CLA" - WTI active
    - Best gauge of market sentiment
*** Generic or Rolling Tickers
    - "Root Ticker" + "1"
    - "CL1" - Front of the month
