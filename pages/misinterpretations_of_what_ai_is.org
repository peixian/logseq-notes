"AI" as a term conflates machine intellgience (Isaac Asimov bullshit) and specific bundles of technologies

The former is weird sci-fi theories about what happens if machines are smarter than you.

The latter requires you to know what a "convolutional neural network is", but it's tons of spam. OpenAI serves the former, but people using the latter glom onto it.
