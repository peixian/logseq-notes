* 1 - The Damocles Zone
  Talks about how the zone is irreversible, requires broad solutions to major problems

** Discussion
   - Richard Hamming - Everything starts with fluids or dyanmics
   - Brett Victor - Work on problems that people don't realize as problems
   - How to tackle science
     - valid modes for the future?
       - spin many plates
       - centrally directed
         - khnuzian dynamics of science
   - What does braben view on scientific production?
     - Finding the projects and finding the applications of the results
   - What is the root cause of the inability to fund these?
     - BP defunded the venture research program, now no one is willing to fund
   - Commitment is what transforms ordinary research into transformative research
   - What works on your problem? Why is a problem yours?

* 2 - Scientific Freedom and Transformative Research

** Discussion
   - Inprecision of what is transformative research
     - This may be actually deliberate, so not to exclude things you can't solve
   - Can you separate the scientist from the problem?
   - Do solutions have to be structured?
     - How do scientists see themselves?
   - Are the hard problems the important problems?
     - How do we select for ideas?
     - Are good ideas expected to bubble up ot the top?
   - Should we select for problems that can't be separated? Some problems are hard, but they can be separated, but this is orthongal to being hard
   - Braben conflates the difficult & the interesting
   - Expand/exploit for problems?
     - When are you expanding into new fields?
   - Why is freedom important
     - Monte Carlo methods
       - random walks
     - Generates higher variance, but not necessarily better results
     - Freedom is actually a constratining factor because now you no longer need to worry about scale
     - success attracts other people, and that in turn becomes ossification
     - localism
       - each field must define what their freedom is
   - VC funding
     - inputs/outputs are both money
       - "do things that don't scale"?

* 3 - Mismanagement by Objectives
  - objectification
    - adoption of math where it does not apply?
      - economics, sociology, etc
  - aligns with china's "china is run by engineers, US is run by lawyers"
  - enormous expenditures -> viruses are still killers -> isn't this objectification
  - grants are not mentored
  - "eastern medicine" -> orientalist approaches here
  - federal funding and freedom do not necessarily generate better approaches
    - middle east studies had freedom for quite a while
  - reshaping of capital markets post-2008
  - is the post-WWII euphoria Braben identifies real? Or is it just because of cheap money?
  - no investor seeking long term gains expects decisive short term returns

** Discussion
   - Freedom/secrecy are at conflict
   - open science vs [[id:AE205EF3-0F38-4602-B1F1-7729B79B7A6F][open source]]?
   - secrecy for whom?
   - can we enable younger scientists?
   - consensus
     - popularity
     - age increases
   - china? empowering younger researchers? [[id:D46394EE-46FE-4FD2-8A0B-EAFD4EEB8210][chinese science statistics]]
   - need for harmonization capping discoveries? Everything is made by consensus?
     - peer review, collaborators
   - universities as a force for social change?
     - are we just admitting too many people?
   - Are the measurements bad? Should we stop measuring output? Or at least limit time-forward metrics?
   - Up or out promotion paths?
   - Calling out a focus on efficiency?
     - [[id:A36DF8A8-3E7F-4D06-8F79-9F1E15B61A80][Mitchel: Economentality]]?
     - Redudancy is valuable -> gives replication
     - Legibility of research
     - measure outcomes -> is this reading the arrow backwards from assessing invidiual people?
   - the shift in the 70's seems to be a mentality shift:
     - science is no longer generically good
     - science needs to illuminate the future
   - metrics result in consensus because everyone aims towards the same thing
   - make scientists as early as possible?
     - stop treating scientific freedom as a reward?
   - popular media -> science has become homogenized
   - Lenin was a mushroom
   - What is consensus good for?

* 4 - Searching for Planck's Successors
  - Threat Fatigue -> losing signals in all the noise
  - Adventure fund attempted to fund "risky" research in the UK in 2002
  - Braben suggests that peer review and consensus are the problem
    - scientist reputations are slowly earned and quickly damaged - 108
    - /responsbility shared is responsbility denied/
  - searching for the "best value for money" is what's leading to the reduction of risk
    - can this be harnessed? Can we capitalize on the risk somehow?
  - Braben suggests that confidence in your research leads to significant and transformative research
  - TR must select for "visionaries", not just glory-seekers
    - measure devotion/hunger
      - how? signals for these are quite bad
  - Musical chairs with the rules are what's being attempted with the smaller fixes on the grant cycle, we need to rethink all of it
  - [[id:ECC21E7C-5A6D-4BD1-B576-DCB47C7497EF][langlands program]] and TR, how did this come about?
  - The Medical Research Council in the UK as an example
