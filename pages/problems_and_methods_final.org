* Outline
** Starting point: /The Community as a system wrt Iraqi Militias/
   Draft: [[id:D00C1BFB-32F5-4BAC-8660-C36D4883BCBF][master's thesis]]
** Concept
    - Communities are often held as the crucial center for deradicalization and reintegration programs. For the context of Iraqi Militias/Hashd al-Shaabi/PMF, what does this look like? How can communities foster peacebuilding within this context?
** Baselines
    - Terrorism "deradicalization" vs DDR vs refugee reintegration
      - Is the difference between terrorism "deradicalization" and militia reintegration a purely judicial/[[id:CC0EFB92-1661-4A5A-BE0D-46FB07D94241][jurisprudence]] one?
        - "Deradicalization" is for "strong" states
        - "reintegration" is for states emerging from post-conflict conditions
        - Refugee reintegration is a whole different ballgame <- have not yet fleshed this one out
    - How do communities impact reintegration programs?
      - Commonly assumed that ideas impact behavior, changing ideas changes behavior (not played out, poor theory, many radicalize/fail to demobilize from the communities they live in)
        - This concept of "ideology" typically atomizes the individual and reduces them to a bag of ideas
      - Feelings of loneliness and outcast
        - Bosnia case - Darryl Li
      - Communities that sustain radicalization/failure to demobilize

    - Sectarianism/Divisions
      - Does it matter? Does it influence [[id:E900796C-250A-474B-9054-C0C109C94A24][ddr]]

          - [[id:E48F6D7F-36EB-4F1E-8DF6-35AF238E024F][muslim brotherhood]]?

      - Other external actors
    - Comparative Cases - What can we compare against?
      - Unique, successful cases (reach out to Patty Chang, Sally Sharif)

** Bring it together
   - Start by talking about how communities, not ideas are the center point for successful reintegrating of former fighters (nepal, namibia)
   - Talk about the current state of the PMF and how they are semi-state
     - Talk about the religious/sectarian aspects of the PMF
   - Talk about how communities impact reintegration programs
   - Answer how peacebuilding works now, and why it doesn't work, and where it's worked before
   - Dive into deeper comparative cases
** Outline
   - Clauswitz On War
   - DDR as a requirement for post-conflict statebuilding
   - Conceptualize the iraqi PMF issue as a dual countery insurgency one and a SSR/DDR one
     - PMF's seen in sectarian caraiture
       - much more complicated, mosaic
   - State lead reintegration on Iraq
   - What lessons have we learned from [[id:A5CACE85-C257-4B0D-93ED-1D1FD8D9BEB5][sierra leone]], [[id:CDA4DF10-6A09-4A00-8666-9A6B5DFC49EC][cote d'ivore]], etc?
   - State lead -> how does this look in comparison to [[id:DB2CC264-A435-4715-8AF6-905254C4A07A][sudan]]?
   - What forms a community on a micro level? How do we define a community? Communities under DDR and SSR?
   - Communities -> reintegration transforms between individual and communal based
     - Also faction leaders
     - How do these play in?
   - use [[id:D0DFC0A3-D11C-44A5-B5C0-410F1B5A5FD5][Simpson - War from the Ground Up]]
*** Introduction
    - rise of daesh
    - PMF and their current status
      - proxies, not proxies, etc
    - militias in the middle east cite:alaaldin_rise_2019
    - counter insurgency, [[id:D0DFC0A3-D11C-44A5-B5C0-410F1B5A5FD5][Simpson - War from the Ground Up]]
    - post-conflict state building via DDR and SSR, [[id:F1B3F2D2-CAAC-457D-A302-DD223805B4E3][Williams - Research Handbook on Post-Conflict Statebuilding]]
*** Current Literature
    - Statebuilding
    - Issues and comparative cases
    - Treating counter insurgency as a means to an end
    - "Sectarianism" [[id:91F18E55-0C3A-4AAD-9B9B-08DDAC831E5E][Dodge - Bourdieu goes to Baghdad]], [[id:025B5FBB-A8D1-4732-AB11-1DABD7BF0001][Dodge - Rethinking Political Identities in Iraq After 2003]]
      - comparative cases -> hezbollah, KH
    - neoliberal framing of iraq, beyond 2003
*** Propose a structure and interpreation
    - move beyond interpreting this as a proxy
    - move beyond interpreting this as a sectarian lens
      - their entry into government unfortunately puts this in deeper sectarian lens, since scholars already tend ot see it in sectarian lens
    - war as politics by other means
    - move into interpreting this as a specific realities
      - what works for peacebuilding?
      - what doesn't work for peacebuilding?
      - state lead SSR?
    - rethinking them as potential destabilizers, as the often the case of the conflict reform
