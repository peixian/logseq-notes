- Constructed by Willcocks in 1911, finished in 1913
- Constructed because the Euphrates splits into two channels south of Musayyib
  - Two braches, the Hilla and the Hindiya branch
  - Closing of the [[id:8EFAEC33-5D0D-4F44-AA4B-48F16B4A0ECD][salqawia canal]] diverted more water down the Euphrates
    - The lower-lying Hindiya branch took more water and started to slit up the Hilla branch
    - Old, previously constructed barrage was not sufficient
- Identified two terminal lakes for euphrates:
  - Lake Milh/بحيرة ملح‎/Lake Razzaz/Lake Abu Dilis
  - Lake Habbaniya
- Proposed to remove old Hindiya barrage after completion of the new, although Arabs objected to it as they had used the old barrage as a bridge
