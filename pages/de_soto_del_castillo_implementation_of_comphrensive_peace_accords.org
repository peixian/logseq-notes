  - transfer of land to former combatants

  - extremely intrusive, basically UN "omnipresence"
- el salvador was largely broken due to income inequality, which then had the landed class nurture a powerful armed forces to protect themselves
- constant external financing problems, especially in light of the problems caused by the collapse in coffee prices, lead to need for more external financing
- international negotiating effor was developed and maintained by the sec gen
- makes the case that el salvador's gains are not irreversible, and the various assinations and killings presents a difficult problem to solve
- "race towards elections" - lulls the international community into thinking that the problem is finished
- questions of "exit scenario", what consitutes a proper exit scenario?
