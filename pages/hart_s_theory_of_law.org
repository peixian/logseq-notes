#+TITLE: hart's theory of law

Tags: [[id:CC0EFB92-1661-4A5A-BE0D-46FB07D94241][jurisprudence]]

- Hart considers the law as conferring powers and imposing duties
- Core focus on the soverign and soverign powers
  - States laws is a social rule
- Counters [[id:A599953A-8285-40F8-8DEF-EB07A4BA8C66][austin's theory of law]]
  - Austen's theory of law has key issues
    - Duty imposing laws
    - Continuity of laws
    - Intelligbility of laws

* 3 Problems Addressed by Hart
  - Assume a pre-legal society where "laws" are social customs
  - Problem of Uncertainty
    - What is a rule? When does a "rule" become a rule?
  - Problem of Stasis
    - How do we change rules? If a pandemic sweeps through the society, can we change it in response or do we need to wait for people to die out first?
  - Problem of Inefficiency
    - If I say a rule is interpreted one way and you say another, how do we resolve those disputes?

* Solutions
  - Metarules -> Rules that guide what rules are
    - Could be "things written in stone are rules" or "things the shaman says are rules"
  - Rule of change
    - Have a rule conferring the authority and positions to change the rules
  - Rule of adjudication
    - Have a rule that adjudicates which rules are which
