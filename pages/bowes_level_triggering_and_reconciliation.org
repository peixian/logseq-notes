Introduces the concepts of edge triggering and level triggering, derived from the idea of an [[id:1703A577-9E10-491F-BAEC-D0E0FEE0AA47][interrupt]], talks about how systems should respond to the shape of an electrical signal over time.

Should the system care about /when/ the signal changes from low <- high or high -> low, or /if/ the signal is high? Thresholds vs state changes

Abstractly, there's no differences between edge and level triggering, the only difference is the [[id:5A2320A9-6519-4DAF-AEFF-8078ECB4601B][sample rate]], if a system doesn't sample fast enough, we may miss a trigger, especially when there's an outage.

Under ideal conditions these are the same.

[[id:A0A37A5E-A266-46B3-8148-D7A40A5F1F78][kubernetes (k8s)]] is focused on reconciling desired and actual states:
