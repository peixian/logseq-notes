5 steps from /So Good They Can't Ignore You/:
1) Decide what capital market you're in, either winner-takes-all or auction
   - CS is auction
   - Middle East studies/academia is...winner takes all? Maybe?
     - writing is winner takes all
2) Identify capital type, which skill dominates?
   - in CS I care about distributed systems skills and navigating large code bases
     - read "working with legacy systems"?

   - with MES my skill is writing and analysis? Possibly arabic?
     - Work on arabic
     - Practice writing
3) Define 'good'
   - Distributed systems:
     - understanding papers, writing more distributed systems, understanding apis
     - Kafka, zookeeper, batching, etc
   - Arabic: obvious
   - Writing: less obvious, but 'good' is defined as getting published?
4) Stretch and destroy: push to activate discomfort
5) Be patient


- build a career moat
  - either out of obscurity/difficulty
    - make it difficult to get where you are
    - choose a path that is unclear how to climb
  - predictive
    - predict valuable skills before they get recgonized
  - skills that are unattractive but valuable
    - cobol? (ehhhhhhhhhh)
    - engineering management

- autonomy is based around leverage
- perform rigorous trial and error <- duh
  - two ways of problem solving
    - trial and error
    - theory and insight

- taking bets
  - stay in the game
  - double down on what works
  - bet in porportional to your edge

- epistemic vs instrumental reality
  - epistemic - how do you know if your beliefs are true?
  - instrumental - how do you make better decisions to achieve your goals?
  - aaron schwartz wrote about this in 2012: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9SE67uz98kh6x2CxR/what-are-the-optimal-biases-to-overcome

- be realistic about what you're selling
  - is your job a commodity?
  - there is always a move if you are selling a unique product or have capital freedom, aka money is time
    - what is your individual free cash flow? that is, how much money can you take out to maintain and grow your current lifestyle?
