* Summary
  Religion and nationalism can be carved into 3 sections:
  - Civil-Religious
  - Religious Nationalism
  - Secular Nationalism

  Can further be divided into stable and unstable components
* Introduction
  | Model                       | Religion-state ideological links    | Religion-state institutional links                       |
  |-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
  | Secular nationalism         | Weak to nonexistent                 | Separation                                               |
  | Religious nationalism       | Strong (with a particular group)    | Multiple religion-state contacts (to a particular group) |
  | Civil-religious nationalism | Supportive (to religion in general) | Benign separation or pluralistic accomodation            |
  - Launa of studies when it comes to nationalism and religion
  - Historically
    - Modenrists focus their attention on the role of language, the print media, and educational system
    - Gellner notes "curious fact" about nations and religion
    - Westphalian system subordinates religion to the state
      - [[id:3D669C14-9C67-43A0-9580-04E5EEB10849][iraq]]'s westphalian system continues with this to today
    - Secular nationalism replaced ethnic and religious identity for national identity based on civic and secular norms
      - friendly "takeover" of religion by nationalism
    - "Post-colonial states like [[id:8167F3DC-A169-4452-B5DC-F6F669C0C038][india]] and [[id:FAC6D0F0-7797-4330-B988-37260A98CBC1][turkey]] aggressively forged secular nationalism"
  - Walzer notes that the revival of religion in [[id:460EF15E-DA2F-4C91-9675-70A0B18EF45E][algeria]], [[id:8167F3DC-A169-4452-B5DC-F6F669C0C038][india]], and [[id:BCB88E11-A4E5-4362-AE55-73D18B323882][israel]] represents rejection of secular nationalism
  - [[id:91ADFC4C-455C-4FCE-9E7B-04EF14C449AB][ireland]] has strong religious identity
  - "secular nationalism presumes the triumph of national over religious identity" - pg 8
  - "civil religious nationalism is rooted in the country's religious experience, but nevertheless develops separately from it"
    - falls short in capturing every regime
  - "Religious nationalism can occur when religious groups are socially and politically strong and have some degree of institutional autonomy" - pg 15
    - [[id:4A892609-EEF5-441D-92CD-0330210D954F][bosnia]] has this, where lack of religious accomodation has lead to the rise of religious identities
  - Religion and state are not static, their discourses change over time
  - "We hypothesize that members of the majority faith are likely to express pro-nationalist sentiments in states with religious nationalism as its model, though this archetype runs the danger of alienating minority faiths" - pg 29
* [[id:97BD1E12-9693-4CF4-8A7E-61DFAC324300][united states]]: Stable Civil-Religious Nationalism
  - US was founded by a mixed group of christians, sects varying wildly
  - US constitution specifices the relationship of state and gov
  - Gov does not interfere with religion, which allows them to spread
  - No anticlerical revolution like in [[id:2F7E55D6-A8D8-41B6-B7D0-09A9D1A09B22][france]]
  - US cares about being "generically" religious, not specifically the sect
  - US religious identity has morphed, adopting Jews and Catholics along the way
  - Religious groups were far more likely to support the Iraq war
    - Evanglicals especially
* [[id:BCB88E11-A4E5-4362-AE55-73D18B323882][israel]]: Unstable Civil-Religious Nationalism
  - Israel's founding brought together Zionists and Jews of all stripes
  - Failed to adopt a constitution, leaving the Basic Law
  - Ambiguity of the Basic Law has lead differing interpretations of religion and the state
  - Ben Gurion was not particularly religious and more socialist, but various different leaders have taken tacks
  - Ultra-Orthodox jews even reject the Zionist project
  - Political Zionism vs cultural Zionism vs Revisionism vs theological Zionism
  - Deeply debated in Israeli society, balance of power in the Knesset has been razor thin, which puts Zionists at the kingmaker role
  - Zionists more likely to favor state aid to settlements
* [[id:D8E7997D-829D-4433-929D-1D7AD4270904][greece]]: Stable Religious Nationalism
  - Greence has long history with religion, founding of the state from ottoman empire has revisionist tendencies about the role of the orthodox church
    - Church hailed as the savior of faith under ottoman rule
      - Similar to other Balkan states, described in [[id:360914DB-207A-458E-A677-B1DC2302A2FA][Anscombe - State, Faith, and Nation]]
  - Orthodox Church has very heavy input on educational policy
  - Most Greeks see religion as an important part of their identity
  - Colors their views on Greece/Turkey relations, especially after the 1934 population exchanges
* [[id:19767910-0590-44C4-850A-672522D7B126][malaysia]]: Unstable Religious Nationalism
  - Constitution theoritically coded towards Islam, although in general is not
  - Recent leaders have attempted to appeal to native Malays and Islam, against Indian and Chinese minorities
  - Most native Malays very poor, Chinese tend to be urban and rich, Indians somewhere in between
  - Constitution amendments does privilage Malays to some extent
    - Rukun Negara was meant to harmonize these changes
  - Hostility to China is not a major change among religions, except Christianity
  - Malaysia forcing established Islam onto the state towards powerful minorities has dangerous ramificiations
* [[id:41774016-50D2-4B0F-9F8C-EAD89C9CACAE][uruguay]]: Stable Secular Nationalism
  - Relatively backwater among Catholics during Spanish rule
  - Had large anticlerical moment
  - Most people not religious, and stable because the religious base was never built up against the state
* [[id:8167F3DC-A169-4452-B5DC-F6F669C0C038][india]]: Unstable Secular Nationalism
  - Powerful religious actors at the construction of the state
  - Indira Ghdani and Rajiv Ghandi both spoke about secularism, but appealed to Hindu nationalism when needed
  - [[id:72488A8A-EAEF-4BE8-964C-C65EF9BFD300][bharatiya janata party (bjp)]] largely appeals to Hindu nationalism
  - Secularism has appeal on the national discourse level, BJP attempts to mix Hindu identity with an Indian one
  - Normative values of secularism being overriden by powerful religious actors
    - goes against the idea that with time, a secular state imposed from top down will secularize the population
