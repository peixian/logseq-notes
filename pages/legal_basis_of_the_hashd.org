    - Shia-led army has been growing for some time
    - widely conceived of needing a "separate but equal" status
    - many advocates do not want it to be folded within an established ministry
      - comfort at the fact that it answers directly to PM
    - successive [[id:4F59D34B-7839-4FA8-A61F-97BCE0E62359][iraqi prime minister]]s have felt like it was necessary to assert their authority
      - [[id:B4495945-1A3F-4927-967A-03C0D2992069][abu mahdi al-muhandis]]'s meddeling
