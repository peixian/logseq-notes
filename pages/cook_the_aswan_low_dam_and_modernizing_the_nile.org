The completion of the Aswan Low Dam was premised on orientialist perceptions that the British would 'modernize' the Egyptians.
- Ended up miscalculating
  - Did not respect the environmental impacts of this
    - British engineers saw this as a time to experiment as well as a time to dig into their "Christian" past for relics
  - Did not respect the cyclic abundance of the Nile
    - Farmers now needed to use more fertilizer
    - Mitchell notes that by 1933 due to the Aswan Low Dam project only, “one-fifth of the Nile valley was now irrigated by the river’s annual flood, which in the past had fertilized the soil by depositing a layer of silt and nutrients…By the end of the 1930s Egyptian farmers were using 600,000 tons of fertilizer a year - pg 7, from [[id:DA346EB5-BAC5-4536-B5BF-886CD9495CF5][Mitchel - Rule of Experts: Egypt, Techno-politics, Modernity]]
- Attempts at the regulating the Nile had been done before
- Persistent belief from the British that the Egyptians were somehow "squandering" the Nile
- Dam did not account for salination like in [[id:807301C8-4F30-48C2-92EA-B4E69A9DD8AA][irrigation in iraq]] with the [[id:B91A9E4D-0BCC-4FDB-A377-CC56F26E5F01][dujayla land project]]
