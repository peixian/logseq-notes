Defined in the broadest sense to include traditional security forces (state and non-state) as well as justice sector, governance, and oversight mechanisms - more ffective and more accountable. SSR is based on the premise that an ineffective and poorly governed secuirty sector is an bstacle to peace, statbility, poverty reduction, and sustainable development (Wulf, 2011: 339). The UN defines it as 'a process of assessment, review, and implementaiton as well as monitoring and evalution of the security sector, lead by national authorities, and that has its goal the enhancement of effective and accountable security for the state and its peoples, without discrimination and with full respect of human rights and the rule of law (UN, 2012: 14)
