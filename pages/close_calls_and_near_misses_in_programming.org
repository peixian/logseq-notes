- we never talk about the close calls
- close calls are never reported
- close calls in alpinism are now sometimes recorded (close calls podcasts)
  - the sharp end
- we have PM's, but inhererntly that's only for things that break, we get better at fixing live problems, but we don't get necessarily better at preventing problems
- how do we better at diagnosing close calls?
