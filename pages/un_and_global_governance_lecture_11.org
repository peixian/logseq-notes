 - the UN thinks it brings solutions, but does not look carefully enough at the coping mechanisms developed in communities
 - a women is always refered to wrt to their relationship to men
 - UNDP - local governance project being looked at
 - most interesting work are happening in the communities
 - not enough engagement with the local community and local history

* Gender
  - Notions of "masculinity" - peace as feminine and war as masculine
    - which leads to the idea that women are more active in peacebuilding activites then they actually are
    - the partipation of women in the peace process
    - requires speciifc advocacy of women following the conflict
  - views on sexual violence are extremely skewed towards women
    - pregent women, mothers, and victims of sexual violence
  - women are entering an institution where the binary of masculinity and feminity are bound
  - gender mainstreaming -> how do you make the topic of gender dead?
    - you make it a mechanical bureacratic process,
    - this is difficult to assess within a particular organization
