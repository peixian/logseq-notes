#+TITLE: heart rate zones

Tags: [[id:3B5A43C1-21E5-4002-BFA9-66B71284CAD0][Workouts]]

Align heart rate zones with [[id:0293CFB9-27D5-4404-8E63-C0EDB19EF09A][training periods]].

* 4 Zones
** Zone 1
   Basic endurance, 55-75% of max HR
   - _Low Speed. At low intensities, predominately using slow twitch (ST) muscle fibers, the rate of ATP production is modest._
** Zone 2
   No man's land, 75-80% of max HR

   - Note that this can "feel" like training, but the gains are small here. Zone 1 is a safer bet.
** Zone 3
   Uppermost aerobic training, 80-90% of max HR
** Zone 4
   Anaerobic zone, 90-95% of max HR
** Zone 5
   Max effort
