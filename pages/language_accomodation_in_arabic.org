- diglossia is common in arabic
- oftentimes you can just say a vague word with the same root and speakers understand it
- is spoken arabic build in more variance within the grammar? location of question words for masri, colloqialisms for different dialects, loan words
- what about language accomodation? are speakers just less willing to accomodate because they expect others to adapt?
