A system can have multiple states of equilibrium. Which equilibrium it reaches is a function of how it got there.

[[id:E02F065B-9B0A-4882-A6DF-7AF9476C5557][hystersis loop]] -> dependence on the state of a system with memory, the state of a system does not merely depend on the external fcators, but rather also depends on how it got there.
This implies there are multiple equilibrium states.

Is this related to [[id:E900796C-250A-474B-9054-C0C109C94A24][ddr]]? Are reintegration a function of only external actors, or does the implementation matter? Is this a common occurance of non-linear systems?
