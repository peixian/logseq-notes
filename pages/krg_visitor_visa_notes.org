  - Notes
    - there are roaming lawyers around the residency office, they will typically talk to the owners
    - Note that the blood test will send it over to the residency office, you do not have to do anything
    - fee for blood test: 31k
    - pay at window 105, which may not have someone
    - likely need a kurdish proxy
