First described by Brad Hedlund for Hadoop in 2012, but Google did this earlier with specialized hardware. Can now be done with off the shelf hardware from [[id:2B1764E5-E51D-408F-B427-E4BE82445307][Arista]] or [[id:E6DB72BE-17F1-48DA-AAB5-0E34FC5EC29A][Juniper]]

- Leaves are "top of rack" switches, spines are densely connected to leaves to get oversubscription of free networks,
- [[id:6536D179-7F7B-48FB-8AD8-89C352607A1F][bgp]] allows automatic routing table builds, and uses [[id:60265470-A863-4953-8514-1D5E5CB58BFD][equal cost multipath (ECMP)]] to spread traffic evenly
