- Criterion: \( f^* = p - \frac{q}{b} = \frac{bp-q}{b} = \frac{bp-(1-p)}{b} = \frac{p(b+1) - 1}{b}\)
  - \(f^*\) is the fraction of the current bankroll to wager
    - how much to bet
  - \(b\) is the net odds received on the wager
    - betting $10, on win, rewards $4 -> \(b = 0.4\)
  - \(p\) is the probability of a win
  - \(q = 1-p\) is the probability of loss


- Maximize the expected log of wealth
  - sometimes known as the "geometric mean maximizing portfolio strategy", maximimizing logarithmic utility, etc
  - derived from [[id:3E0B9612-FC1C-486C-85C5-F1F6BB60E53A][Shannon - A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]
