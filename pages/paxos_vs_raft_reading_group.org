- using [[id:F6AB05A3-B84F-42DB-8A9F-62470C836025][raft]] terminology to describe [[id:B61CD1FF-6157-4754-A625-A1AE4FCC5770][paxos]]
- raft has weird situation when majority-accepted but not committed value may get chopped off due to leader churn

states that:
- paxos is hard to understand because the language is obtuse, raft was written with an engineering audience in mind
- raft has significantly more reference implementations
- leader election efficiency
  - [[id:E26C2A70-898F-4FC6-8DCE-E9009A631AE2][cloudflare outage]]
- [[id:F6AB05A3-B84F-42DB-8A9F-62470C836025][raft]] may be an implementation of [[id:7D1A0BE4-7B9F-47C7-AD76-AE8D17A3E3BB][multi-paxos]]
- [[id:401ECB02-63D9-4A4D-9AA8-95853F5232AA][Wang et al: On the Parallels between Paxos and Raft, and how to Port Optimizations]]
  - can you port raft optimizations back into paxos
- what other algorithms are out there?  [[id:605258DD-10C6-4840-AE8F-28F636DB8C24][epaxos]]
- which one is more teachable?
