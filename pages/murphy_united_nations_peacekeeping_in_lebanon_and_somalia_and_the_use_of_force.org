- Examines [[id:1E643F52-8B76-4E7A-93B2-117255EF9DA2][unifil]] and UN operations in somalia, especially wrt to the rule of engagement
- Two aspects of the use of force in peacekeeping
  - Minimum use of force
    - This was used (and crossed) by the somilia missions
      - going after a specific actor placed the UN as "one actor among many"
  - Force for self defense only
    - UNFIL's stand and holding villages has allowed them to maintain a pretense of neutrality
- somalia as a testing ground for new use of force rules (chapter VII)
- UNIFIL has been awkward since the lebanese gov has depended upon it for various enforcement activities
  - UNIFIL ROE has been modified to become less restricive over time, as compared to the UNPROFOR (somalia) ones, where they were very restrictive
  - after May 1993, the UNOSOM II ROE was changed to become a "blank check"
    - UNOSOM II ROE was largely confused and no effort was made to integrate (especially with the italians)
      - incoherence of Italians, where the italians knew how to negotiate whereas the rest of the UN forces did not
- UNIFIL not confronting the PLO meant that they couldn't confront the Israeli de facto forces either
- UNIFIL stand at At-Tiri lead to the creation of Force Mobile Reserve
